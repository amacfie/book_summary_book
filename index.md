## Watership Down (1972)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down>

### Part 1 {#part_1}

In the Sandleford warren, Fiver, a young runt rabbit who is a seer,
receives a frightening vision of his warren\'s imminent destruction.
When he and his brother Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the
need to evacuate, they set out on their own, accompanied by nine other
rabbits who choose to go with them. The first challenge in the small
band\'s search for a new home comes immediately, as they are forced to
elude the Owsla, the warren\'s military caste, who believe they are
trying to spread dissent against the chief.Once out in the world, the
travelling group of rabbits finds itself following the leadership of
Hazel, who, until now, has been just another unimportant member of the
warren. The group travels far and through dangerous territory. Bigwig
and Silver, both former Owsla and the strongest rabbits among them, do
well to keep the others protected, along with Hazel\'s keen observations
and good judgment. Along the way, they evade a badger (known in Lapine
as lendris), a dog, a car, and a crow; Hazel also manages to stop three
rabbits from returning to the Sandleford warren.They meet a rabbit named
Cowslip, who invites them to join his warren. At first, Hazel\'s group
are largely relieved to finally be able to sleep and feed well -- except
for Fiver, who senses only death there. Bigwig, Blackberry and Fiver\'s
friend Pipkin suspect something suspicious, but they don\'t think too
much of it. When Bigwig is nearly killed in a snare, Fiver, in a crazed
lecture, makes the group realise the new warren is managed by a farmer
who protects and feeds the rabbits, but also harvests a number of them
for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply
using Hazel and the others to increase their own odds of survival. Fiver
and the rest of the group work together to rescue Bigwig from the snare,
then continue on their journey, taking with them a rabbit from
Cowslip\'s warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after it is
implied that his doe is killed in a snare.

### Part 2 {#part_2}

Fiver\'s visions have promised them a safe place in which to settle, and
the group eventually finds Watership Down, which matches Fiver\'s
description of the perfect home exactly. There they are soon reunited
with Holly and Bluebell, who were with Bigwig in the Owsla. The two are
nursing severe injuries which, they reveal, were inflicted as they
escaped the violent human destruction of Sandleford, and then later at
Cowslip\'s warren. Holly also confesses it was he who had tried to stop
them leaving that first night rather than working under the chief
rabbit\'s orders, but Fiver\'s vision coming true has left him a changed
rabbit and he is there to join them in whatever way they will have him.

Although Watership Down is a peaceful habitat, Hazel realises there are
no does, making the future of the warren certain to end with the
inevitable deaths of the rabbits present. With the help of their useful
new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they locate a nearby
warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded and has many does. Hazel
sends a small embassy, led by Holly, to Efrafa to present their request
for does.Meanwhile, Hazel and Pipkin, the smallest member of the group,
scout the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find two pairs of hutch
rabbits. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the hutch rabbits
are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the
next day, during which he rescues both does but only one of the bucks,
and at the expense of badly injuring Hazel\'s hind-leg. When the
emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is
a police state led by the despotic General Woundwort. Holly and the
other rabbits dispatched there have managed to return with little more
than their lives intact.

### Parts 3 and 4 {#parts_3_and_4}

However, Holly\'s group has managed to identify an Efrafan doe named
Hyzenthlay who wishes to leave the warren, and can recruit other does to
join in the escape. Hazel and Bigwig devise a plan to rescue
Hyzenthlay\'s group and bring them to Watership Down; Bigwig is sent to
do the mission, with infrequent help from Kehaar, and the group escape
using a raft. Again, Bigwig nearly dies in the escape attempt. Once they
are at Watership Down, the Efrafan escapees start their new life of
freedom.Shortly thereafter, however, the Owsla of Efrafa, led by
Woundwort himself, arrives to attack and colonise the warren at
Watership Down. Through Bigwig\'s bravery and loyalty, and Hazel\'s
ingenuity, the Watership Down rabbits seal the fate of the Efrafan
general by unleashing the Nuthanger Farm watchdog. As the Efrafans flee
in terror, Woundwort, despite being greatly wounded in his battle with
Bigwig, refuses to back down and leaps at the dog. His body is never
found, and at least one of his former followers continues to believe in
his survival. Hazel is nearly killed by one of the farmhouse cats, but
he is saved by the farm girl Lucy, the former owner of the escaped hutch
rabbits.

### Epilogue

The story\'s epilogue tells the reader of how Hazel, dozing in his
burrow \"one chilly, blustery morning in March\" some years later, is
visited by El-ahrairah, the spiritual overseer of all rabbits, and hero
of all traditional rabbit stories. El-ahrairah invites Hazel to join his
own Owsla, reassuring him of his warren\'s success and its future.
Leaving his friends and no-longer-needed body behind, Hazel departs
Watership Down with the spirit guide.

## Sense and Sensibility (1811)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_Sensibility>

Henry Dashwood, his second wife, and their three daughters live for many
years with Henry\'s wealthy bachelor uncle at Norland Park, a large
country estate in Sussex. That uncle decides, in late life, to will the
use and income only of his property first to Henry, then to Henry\'s
first son (by his first marriage) John Dashwood, so that the property
should pass intact to John\'s three-year-old son Harry. The uncle dies,
but Henry lives just a year after that and he is unable in such short
time to save enough money for his wife Mrs Dashwood, and their
daughters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, who are left only a small
income. On his deathbed, Mr Henry Dashwood extracts a promise from his
son John to take care of his half-sisters. But before Henry is long in
the grave, John\'s greedy wife, Fanny, persuades her husband to renege
on the promise, appealing to his concerns about diminishing his own son
Harry\'s inheritance, despite the fact that John is already
independently wealthy thanks to both his inheritance from his mother,
and his wife\'s dowry. Henry Dashwood\'s love for his second family is
also used by Fanny to arouse her husband\'s jealousy, and persuade him
not to help his sisters financially. John and Fanny immediately move in
as the new owners of Norland, while the Dashwood women are treated as
unwelcome guests by a spiteful Fanny. Mrs Dashwood seeks somewhere else
to live. In the meantime, Fanny\'s brother, Edward Ferrars, visits
Norland and is attracted to Elinor. Fanny disapproves of their budding
romance, and offends Mrs Dashwood by implying that Elinor must be
motivated by his expectations of coming into money. Mrs Dashwood moves
her family to Barton Cottage in Devonshire, near the home of her cousin,
Sir John Middleton. Their new home is modest, but they are warmly
received by Sir John and welcomed into local society, meeting his wife,
Lady Middleton, his mother-in-law, the garrulous but well-meaning Mrs
Jennings, and his friend, Colonel Brandon. Colonel Brandon is attracted
to Marianne, and Mrs Jennings teases them about it. Marianne is not
pleased, as she considers the thirty-five-year-old Colonel Brandon an
old bachelor, incapable of falling in love or inspiring love in anyone.

While out for a walk, Marianne gets caught in the rain, slips, and
sprains her ankle. The dashing John Willoughby sees the accident and
assists her, picking her up and carrying her back to her home. After his
rescue of her, Marianne quickly comes to admire his good looks and his
similar tastes in poetry, music, art, and love. His attentions, and
Marianne\'s behaviour, lead Elinor and Mrs Dashwood to suspect that the
couple are secretly engaged. Elinor cautions Marianne against her
unguarded conduct, but Marianne refuses to check her emotions.
Willoughby engages in several intimate activities with Marianne,
including taking her to see the home he expects to inherit one day and
obtaining a lock of her hair. When an engagement, or at least the
announcement of one, seems imminent, Mr Willoughby instead informs the
Dashwoods that his aunt, upon whom he is financially dependent, is
sending him to London on business, indefinitely. Marianne is distraught
and abandons herself to her sorrow. Edward Ferrars pays a short visit to
Barton Cottage, but seems unhappy. Elinor fears that he no longer has
feelings for her, but she will not show her heartache. After Edward
departs, sisters Anne and Lucy Steele, vulgar cousins of Mrs. Jennings,
come to stay at Barton Park. Lucy informs Elinor in confidence of her
secret four-year engagement to Edward Ferrars that started when he was
studying with her uncle, and she displays proof of their intimacy.
Elinor realises Lucy\'s visit and revelations are the result of her
jealousy and cunning calculation, and it helps Elinor to understand
Edward\'s recent sadness and behaviour towards her. She acquits Edward
of blame and pities him for being held to a loveless engagement to Lucy
by his sense of honour. Elinor and Marianne accompany Mrs Jennings to
London. On arriving, Marianne rashly writes several personal letters to
Willoughby, which go unanswered. When they meet by chance at a dance,
Willoughby is with another woman. He greets Marianne reluctantly and
coldly, to her extreme distress. She leaves the party completely
distraught. Soon Marianne receives a curt letter enclosing their former
correspondence and love tokens, including a lock of her hair. Willoughby
is revealed to be engaged to a young lady, Miss Grey, who has a large
fortune. Marianne is devastated. After Elinor reads the letter, Marianne
admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby were never engaged. She behaved
as if they were because she knew she loved him and thought that he loved
her. As Marianne grieves, Colonel Brandon visits and reveals to Elinor
that Willoughby seduced, impregnated, then abandoned Brandon\'s young
ward, Miss Eliza Williams. Willoughby\'s aunt subsequently disinherited
him, and so, in great personal debt, he chose to marry Miss Grey for her
money. Eliza is the illegitimate daughter of Brandon\'s first love, also
called Eliza, a young woman who was his father\'s ward and an heiress.
She was forced into an unhappy marriage to Brandon\'s elder brother, in
order to shore up the family\'s debts, and that marriage ended in
scandal and divorce while Brandon was abroad with the Army. After
Colonel Brandon\'s father and brother died, he inherited the family
estate and returned to find Eliza dying in a pauper\'s home, so Brandon
took charge of raising her young daughter. Brandon tells Elinor that
Marianne strongly reminds him of the elder Eliza for her sincerity and
sweet impulsiveness. Brandon removed the younger Eliza to the country,
and reveals to Elinor all of these details in the hope that Marianne
could get some consolation in discovering Willoughby\'s true character.
Meanwhile, the Steele sisters have come to London as guests of Mrs
Jennings. After a brief acquaintance, they are asked to stay at John and
Fanny Dashwood\'s London house. Lucy sees the invitation as a personal
compliment, rather than what it is: a slight to Elinor and Marianne who,
being family, should have received such an invitation first. Too
talkative, Anne Steele betrays Lucy\'s secret engagement to Edward
Ferrars, Fanny\'s brother. As a result, the sisters are turned out of
the house, and Edward is ordered by his wealthy mother to break off the
engagement on pain of disinheritance. Edward, still sensitive of the
dishonour of a broken engagement and how it would reflect poorly on Lucy
Steele, refuses to comply. He is immediately disinherited in favour of
his brother, Robert, which gains him respect for his conduct and
sympathy from Elinor and Marianne. Colonel Brandon shows his admiration
by offering Edward the living (a clergyman\'s income) of the Delaford
parsonage, so to enable him to marry Lucy after he takes orders. Mrs
Jennings takes Elinor and Marianne to the country to visit her second
daughter, Mrs. Charlotte Palmer, at her husband\'s estate, Cleveland.
Marianne, still in misery over Willoughby\'s marriage, goes walking in
the rain and becomes dangerously ill. She is diagnosed with putrid
fever, and it is believed that her life is in danger. Elinor writes to
Mrs. Dashwood to explain the gravity of the situation, and Colonel
Brandon volunteers to go and bring Marianne\'s mother to Cleveland to be
with her. In the night, Willoughby arrives and reveals to Elinor that
his love for Marianne was genuine and that losing her has made him
miserable. He elicits Elinor\'s pity because his choice has made him
unhappy, but she is disgusted by the callous way in which he talks of
Miss Williams and his own wife. He also reveals that his aunt said she
would have forgiven him if he married Miss Williams but that he had
refused. Marianne recovers from her illness, and Elinor tells her of
Willoughby\'s visit. Marianne realises she could never have been happy
with Willoughby\'s immoral, erratic, and inconsiderate ways. She values
Elinor\'s more moderated conduct with Edward and resolves to model
herself after her courage and good sense. Edward later arrives and
reveals that, after his disinheritance, Lucy jilted him in favour of his
now wealthy younger brother, Robert. Elinor is overjoyed. Edward and
Elinor marry, and later Marianne marries Colonel Brandon, having
gradually come to love him. The two couples live as neighbours, with
both sisters and husbands in harmony with each other. Willoughby
considers Marianne as his ideal but the narrator tells the reader not to
suppose that he was never happy.

## Pride and Prejudice (1813)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice>

The novel is set in rural England in the early 19th century. Mrs Bennet
attempts to persuade Mr Bennet to visit Mr Bingley, a rich bachelor
recently arrived in the neighbourhood. After some verbal sparring with
her husband, Mrs Bennet believes he will not call on Mr Bingley. Shortly
after, he visits Netherfield, Mr Bingley\'s rented residence, much to
Mrs Bennet\'s delight. The visit is followed by an invitation to a ball
at the local assembly rooms that the entire neighbourhood will attend.
At the ball, Mr Bingley\'s friendly and cheerful manner makes him
popular with guests. He appears attracted to Jane Bennet (the Bennets\'
eldest daughter), with whom he dances twice. Bingley\'s friend, Mr
Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy, is haughty and aloof, causing a
decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with Elizabeth (the
Bennets\' second eldest daughter), stating she is not attractive enough
to tempt him. Elizabeth finds this amusing and jokes about it with her
sisters. Mr Bingley\'s sister, Caroline, later invites Jane to
Netherfield for dinner. On her way there, Jane is caught in a rain
shower and develops a bad cold, forcing her to stay at Netherfield to
recuperate. When Elizabeth goes to see Jane, Mr Darcy finds himself
becoming attracted to Elizabeth, while Miss Bingley grows jealous, as
she herself has designs on Mr Darcy.

Mr Collins, Mr Bennet\'s cousin and heir to the Longbourn estate, visits
the Bennet family. He is a pompous, obsequious clergyman who intends to
marry one of the Bennet girls. After learning that Jane may soon be
engaged, he quickly decides on Elizabeth, the next daughter in both age
and beauty. Elizabeth and her family meet the dashing and charming army
officer, George Wickham, who singles out Elizabeth. He says he is
connected to the Darcy family and claims Mr Darcy deprived him of an
occupation (a permanent position as a clergyman in a prosperous parish
with good revenue) promised to him by Mr Darcy\'s late father.
Elizabeth\'s dislike of Mr Darcy is confirmed.At the ball at
Netherfield, Mr Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance, and, despite her vow
never to dance with him, she accepts. Excluding Jane and Elizabeth,
several Bennet family members display a distinct lack of decorum. Mrs
Bennet hints loudly that she fully expects Jane and Bingley to become
engaged, and the younger Bennet sisters expose the family to ridicule by
their silliness. Mr Collins proposes to Elizabeth. She rejects him, to
her mother\'s fury and her father\'s relief. Shortly after, the Bingleys
suddenly depart for London with no plans to return. After Elizabeth\'s
rejection, Mr Collins proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a sensible young
woman and Elizabeth\'s friend. Charlotte, older (27), is grateful for a
proposal that guarantees her a comfortable home. Elizabeth is aghast at
such pragmatism in matters of love. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Jane visits
her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London. It soon is clear that Miss
Bingley has no intention of resuming their acquaintance leaving Jane
upset, though composed. In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr
Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park,
the imposing home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, imperious patroness of Mr
Collins and Mr Darcy\'s wealthy aunt. Lady Catherine expects Mr Darcy to
marry her daughter, as planned in his childhood by his aunt and mother.
Mr Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at
Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr Darcy recently saved a
friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth
realises the prevented engagement was to Jane and is horrified that Mr
Darcy interfered. Later, Mr Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his
love for her despite her inferior social rank. She rejects him angrily,
stating she could never love a man who caused her sister such
unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr
Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane, and
suggests that he had been kinder to Bingley than to himself. He
dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham sarcastically, but does not
address it. Later, Mr Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, explaining that
Wickham, the son of his late father\'s steward, had refused the living
his father arranged for him, and was instead given money for it. Wickham
quickly squandered the money and when impoverished, asked for the living
again. After being refused, he tried to elope with Darcy\'s 15-year-old
sister, Georgiana, for her considerable dowry. Mr Darcy also writes that
he separated Jane and Bingley because due to Jane\'s reserved behaviour,
he sincerely believed her indifferent to Bingley, and also because of
the lack of propriety of the other members of her family.

Some months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour of
Derbyshire. They visit Pemberley, the Darcy estate (after Elizabeth
ascertains Mr Darcy\'s absence). The housekeeper there describes Mr
Darcy as kind and generous, recounting several examples of these
characteristics. When Mr Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly
gracious and later invites Elizabeth and the Gardiners to meet his
sister, and Mr Gardiner to go fishing. Elizabeth is surprised and
delighted by their treatment. She then receives news that her sister
Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr Darcy immediately, then
departs in haste, believing she will never see him again as Lydia has
ruined the family\'s good name. After an agonising interim, Wickham has
agreed to marry Lydia. With some veneer of decency restored, Lydia
visits the family and tells Elizabeth that Mr Darcy was at her and
Wickham\'s wedding. Though Mr Darcy had sworn everyone involved to
secrecy, Mrs Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he
secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself. She hints
that he may have had \"another motive\" for having done so, implying
that she believes Darcy to be in love with Elizabeth. Mr Bingley and Mr
Darcy return to Netherfield. Bingley proposes to Jane, who accepts. Lady
Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr
Darcy, visits Elizabeth and demands she promise never to accept Mr
Darcy\'s proposal. Elizabeth refuses and the outraged Lady Catherine
leaves. Darcy, heartened by his aunt\'s indignant relaying of
Elizabeth\'s response, again proposes to her and is accepted. Elizabeth
has difficulty in convincing her father that she is marrying for love,
not position and wealth, but Mr Bennet is finally convinced. The novel
concludes with an overview of the marriages of the three daughters and
the great satisfaction of both parents at the fine, happy matches made
by Jane and Elizabeth.

## The Adventures of Augie March (1953)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Augie_March>

The story describes Augie March\'s growth from childhood to a fairly
stable maturity. Augie, with his brother Simon and the mentally abnormal
George have no father and are brought up by their mother who is losing
her eyesight, and a tyrannical grandmother-like boarder in very humble
circumstances in the rough parts of Chicago. Augie drifts from one
situation to another in a free-wheeling manner---jobs, women, homes,
education and lifestyle. Augie March\'s path seems to be partly
self-made and partly comes around through chance. In lifestyle he ranges
from near adoption by a wealthy couple who spoil him, to a struggle for
existence stealing books and helping out friends in desperate straits.
His most unusual adventure is his flight to Mexico with the wild and
irrepressible Thea who tries to catch lizards with an eagle. Thea
attempts to convince Augie to join her in this seemingly impossible
task. His jobs include general assistance to the slightly corrupt
Einhorn, helping in a dog training parlor, working for his brother at a
coal-tip, and working for the Congress of Industrial Organizations until
finally he joins the merchant navy in the war. Augie attracts and gets
involved with a string of different women. Firstly a casual acquaintance
as a youth, he gets engaged to a wealthy cousin of his brother\'s wife.
However, through a scandal not of his fault, he is discarded. After a
casual affair with Sophie, a Greek hotel maid, he is swept off by Thea,
whom he had met when living with the rich Renlings and who forecast
their relationship even though he loved her sister. After the fiasco in
Mexico, where he suffered a terrible accident on a horse, he and Thea
began drifting apart; he spending his time playing cards and she hunting
for snakes and lizards in the mountains. Their inevitable split came the
night he agreed to drive another woman, Stella, to another town to
escape her troubled boyfriend. After the break-up, Augie returned to
Chicago and picked back up with Sophie until joining the merchant navy
and heading to New York. There he met up with Stella again and married
her. All through the book, Augie is encouraged into education, but never
quite seems to make it; he reads a great deal for himself and develops a
philosophy of life. Something or somebody always tends to crop up,
turning his path before Augie seriously considers returning to
education. During the war, his ship is sunk and he suffers a difficult
episode in a lifeboat with a man who turns out to be a lunatic. After
rescue, he returns to Stella and the book ends with them living a
slightly dubious existence in France, he involved in some fairly shady
business deals and she attempting to pursue a career in acting.


## Henderson the Rain King (1959)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson_the_Rain_King>

Eugene Henderson is a troubled middle-aged man. Despite his riches, high
social status, and physical prowess, he feels restless and unfulfilled,
and harbors a spiritual void that manifests itself as an inner voice
crying out I want, I want, I want. Hoping to discover what the voice
wants, Henderson goes to Africa. Upon reaching Africa, Henderson splits
with his original group and hires a native guide, Romilayu. Romilayu
leads Henderson to the village of the Arnewi, where Henderson befriends
the leaders of the village. He learns that the cistern from which the
Arnewi get their drinking water is plagued by frogs, thus rendering the
water \"unclean\" according to local taboos. Henderson attempts to save
the Arnewi by ridding them of the frogs, but his enthusiastic scheme
ends in disaster, destroying the frogs but also the village\'s cistern.
Henderson and Romilayu travel on to the village of the Wariri. Here,
Henderson impulsively performs a feat of strength by moving the giant
wooden statue of the goddess Mummah and unwittingly becomes the Wariri
Rain King, Sungo. He quickly develops a friendship with the native-born
but western-educated Chief, King Dahfu, with whom he engages in a series
of far-reaching philosophical discussions. The elders send Dahfu to find
a lion, which is supposedly the reincarnation of the late king, Dahfu\'s
father. The lion hunt fails and the lion mortally wounds the king.
Henderson learns shortly before Dahfu\'s death that the Rain King is the
next person in the line of succession for the throne. Having no interest
in being king and desiring only to return home, Henderson flees the
Wariri village. Although it is unclear whether Henderson has truly found
spiritual contentment, the novel ends on an optimistic and uplifting
note.


# Lord Byron

## Don Juan (1824)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_(poem)>

### The Argument {#the_argument}

The story, told in seventeen cantos, begins with the birth of Don Juan.
As a young man he is precocious sexually, and has an affair with a
friend of his mother. The husband finds out, and Don Juan is sent away
to Cádiz. On the way, he is shipwrecked, survives and meets the daughter
of a pirate, whose men sell Don Juan as a slave. A young woman, who is a
member of a sultan\'s harem, sees that this slave is purchased. She
disguises him as a girl and sneaks him into her chambers. Don Juan
escapes, joins the Russian army and rescues a Muslim girl named Leila.
Don Juan meets Catherine the Great, who asks him to join her court. Don
Juan becomes sick, is sent to England, where he finds someone to watch
over Leila. Next, a few adventures involving the aristocracy of Britain
ensue. The poem ends with Canto XVII.

### Canto I {#canto_i}

Don Juan lives in Seville with his father José and his mother Donna
Inez. Donna Julia, 23 years old and married to Don Alfonso, begins to
desire Don Juan when he is 16 years old. Despite her attempt to resist,
Julia begins an affair with Juan. Julia falls in love with Juan. Don
Alfonso, suspecting that his wife may be having an affair, bursts into
their bedroom followed by a \"posse concomitant\" but they do not find
anything suspicious upon first searching the room, for Juan was hiding
in the bed. However, when Alfonso returns on his own, he comes across
Juan\'s shoes and a fight ensues. Juan escapes, however. In order to
avoid the rumors and bad reputation her son has brought upon himself,
Inez sends him away to travel, in the hopes that he develops better
morals, while Julia is sent to a nunnery.

### Canto II {#canto_ii}

Canto II describes how Juan goes on a voyage from Cádiz with servants
and his tutor Pedrillo. Juan is still in love with Julia, and after a
period of seasickness, a storm sinks the ship. The crew climb into a
long boat, but soon run out of food. The crew decide to draw lots in
order to choose who will be eaten. Juan\'s tutor Pedrillo is chosen
after Juan\'s dog has also been eaten. However, those that eat Pedrillo
go mad and die. Juan is the sole survivor of the journey; he eventually
makes it onto land at Cyclades in the Aegean. Haidée and her maid Zoe
discover Juan and care for him in a cave by the beach. Haidée and Juan
fall in love despite the fact that neither can understand each other\'s
language. Haidée\'s father Lambro is a \"fisherman\" and pirate who
makes money from capturing slaves.

### Canto III {#canto_iii}

Canto III is essentially a long digression from the main story in which
Byron, in the style of an epic catalogue, describes Haidée and Don
Juan\'s celebrations. The islanders believe Haidée\'s father, Lambro,
has died, but he returns and witnesses these revels. Towards the end of
the canto, Byron insults his contemporaries William Wordsworth, Robert
Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In this latter section is \"The
Isles of Greece\", a section numbered differently from the rest of the
canto with a different verse, which explores Byron\'s views on Greece\'s
status as a \"slave\" to the Ottoman Empire.

### Canto IV {#canto_iv}

Haidée and Juan wake to discover that Haidée\'s father, Lambro, has
returned. Lambro confronts Juan and attacks him with the aid of his
pirate friends. Haidée despairs at losing her lover and eventually dies
of a broken heart with her unborn child still in her womb. Juan is sent
away on a ship and ends up at a slave market in Constantinople.

### Canto V {#canto_v}

Juan is in the slave market. He converses with an Englishman, telling of
his lost love, whereas the more experienced John says he had to run away
from his third wife. A black eunuch from the seraglio, Baba, buys Juan
and John, and takes the infidels to the palace. He takes them to an
inner chamber, where he insists that Don Juan dress as a woman and
threatens him with castration if he resists. Finally, Juan is brought
into an imperial hall to meet the sultana, Gulbeyaz, a 26-year-old
beauty who is the sultan\'s fourth, last and favourite wife. Full of
stubborn pride, he refuses to kiss her foot and finally compromises by
kissing her hand. She had spotted Juan at the market and had asked Baba
to secretly purchase him for her, despite the risk of discovery by the
sultan. She wants Juan to \"love\" her, and throws herself on his
breast. But he still has thoughts of Haidée and spurns her advances,
saying \"The prisoned eagle will not pair, nor I/Serve a sultana\'s
sensual phantasy.\" She is taken aback, enraged, and thinks of having
him beheaded, but breaks out in tears instead. Before they can progress
further in their relationship, Baba rushes in to announce that the
Sultan is coming: \"The sun himself has sent me like a ray/To hint that
he is coming up this way.\" The sultan arrives, preceded by a parade of
damsels, eunuchs, etc.. Looking around, he takes note of the attractive
Christian woman (Juan), expressing regret that a mere Christian should
be so pretty (Juan is a giaour, or non-Muslim). Byron comments on the
necessity to secure the chastity of the women in these unhappy climes
--- that \"wedlock and a padlock mean the same.\"

### Canto VI {#canto_vi}

The sultan retires with Gulbeyaz. Juan, still dressed as a woman, is
taken to the overcrowded seraglio. He is asked to share a couch with the
young and lovely 17-year-old Dudù. When asked what his name is, Don Juan
calls himself Juanna. She is a \"kind of sleepy Venus \... very fit to
murder sleep\... Her talents were of the more silent class\...
pensive\...\" She gives Juanna a chaste kiss and undresses. The chamber
of odalisques is asleep at 3 AM. Dudù suddenly screams, and awakens
agitated, while Juanna still lies asleep and snoring. The women ask the
cause of her scream, and she relates a suggestive dream of being in a
wood like Dante, of dislodging a reluctant golden apple clinging
tenaciously to its bough (which at last willingly falls), of almost
biting into the forbidden fruit when a bee flies out from it and stings
her to the heart. The matron of the seraglio decides to place Juanna
with another odalisque, but Dudù begs to keep her in her own bed, hiding
her face in Juanna\'s breast. The poet is at a loss to explain why she
screamed. In the morning, the sultana asks Baba to tell her how Don Juan
passed the night. He tells of \"her\" stay in the seraglio, but
carefully omits details about Dudù and her dream. But the sultana is
suspicious nevertheless, becomes enraged, and instructs Baba to have
Dudù and Juan killed in the usual manner (drowning). Baba pleads with
her that killing Juan will not cure what ails her. The sultana summons
Dudù and Juan. Just before the canto ends, the narrator explains that
the \"Muse will take a little touch at warfare.\"

### Canto VII {#canto_vii}

Juan and John Johnson have escaped with two women from the seraglio, and
arrive during the siege of Ismail (historically 1790), a Turkish fort at
the mouth of the Danube on the Black Sea. Field Marshal Suvaroff, an
officer in the Russian army, is preparing for an all-out final assault
against the besieged fortress. The battle rages. He has been told to
\"take Ismail at whatever price\" by Prince Potemkin, the
commander-in-chief of the Russian army. The Christian empress Catherine
II is the Russian head-of-state. John Johnson appears to Suvaroff (with
whom he has previously served in battle at Widdin) and introduces his
friend Juan---both are ready to join the fight against the \"pagan\"
Turks. Suvaroff is unhappy with the women the two men brought, but they
state that they are the wives of other men, and that the women aided
their escape. Suvaroff consents to the women staying.

### Canto VIII {#canto_viii}

Juan and John join fearlessly and bravely in the savage assault on
Ismail. They scale the walls of the town and charge into battle. The
conquest of Ismail causes the slaughter of 40,000 Turks, among them
women (a few of whom are raped) and children. Juan nobly rescues a
ten-year-old Muslim girl from two murderous Cossacks intent on killing
her, and immediately resolves to adopt her as his own child. A noble
Tartar khan valiantly fights to the death beside his five sons, just as
instructed by Muhammed, presumably to be rewarded with houris in heaven.
Juan is a hero and is sent to Saint Petersburg, accompanied by the
Muslim girl, whom he makes a vow to protect. Her name, Leila, is only
revealed in Canto X.

### Canto IX {#canto_ix}

Dressed as a war hero in military uniform, Juan cuts a handsome figure
in the court of Catherine II, who lusts after him. She is about 48 years
old (historically, actually 61 or 62 years old) and \"just now in juicy
vigour\". He becomes one of her favorites and is flattered by her
interest as well as promoted for it. \"Love is vanity,/Selfish in its
beginning as its end,/Except where \'tis a mere insanity\". Juan still
lovingly cares for the Muslim girl he rescued.

### Canto X {#canto_x}

Juan falls ill because of the Russian cold and so is sent westward to
more temperate England. His job ostensibly is that of a special envoy
with the nebulous task of negotiating some treaty or other, but it is
nothing more than a sinecure to justify the Empress Catherine in
securing his health and loading him with money and expensive gifts.

### Canto XI {#canto_xi}

Juan lands in England and eventually makes his way to London where he is
found musing on the greatness of Britain as a defender of freedoms ---
until he is interrupted by a Cockney mugger, demanding money with
menace. Juan shoots the man and, being of strong conscience, then
regrets his haste and attempts to care for the dying mugger. However,
his efforts fail, and after muttering some last words the mugger dies on
the street. Later, Don Juan is received into the English court with the
usual wonder and admiration at his looks, dress and mien although not
without the jealousy of some of the older peers. In this Canto, Byron
mentions John Keats, \"who was kill\'d off by one critique\".

### Canto XII {#canto_xii}

Don Juan seeks out a suitable tutor and guardian for Leila, the orphan
from the destroyed city of Ismail. He finds one in Lady Pinchbeck, a
woman not unassailed by rumours on her chastity, but generally
considered a good person and an admirable wit.

### Canto XIII {#canto_xiii}

Lady Adeline Amundeville and her husband Lord Henry Amundeville host
Juan and others. She is \"the fair most fatal Juan ever met\", the
\"queen bee, the glass of all that\'s fair,/Whose charms made all men
speak and women dumb\". Diplomatic relations often bring Juan (\"the
envoy of a secret Russian mission\") and Lord Henry together, and he
befriends Juan and makes him a frequent guest at their London mansion.
The Amundevilles invite numerous distinguished guests for a party at
their country estate. The landscape surrounding the estate, as well as
the decor within their house is described. This is followed by a
mock-catalogues of the ladies, the gentlemen and the activities that
they participate in. Byron sees this whole party as English ennui. The
canto ends with all of them retiring for the evening.

### Canto XIV {#canto_xiv}

Juan acquits himself well on a fox hunt. He is attractive to the ladies,
including the Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who begins to flirt with him. Lady
Adeline is jealous of the Duchess (who has had many amorous exploits),
and resolves to protect the \"inexperienced\" Juan from her enticements.
Juan and Adeline are both 21 years old. Lady Adeline has a vacant heart
and has a cold but proper marriage. She is not in love with Juan, but
the poet will only later divulge whether they have an affair (apparently
not). The popular saying \"truth is stranger than fiction\" originates
from this canto: \"\'Tis strange --- but true; for truth is always
strange; Stranger than fiction.\"

### Canto XV {#canto_xv}

Lady Adeline is at risk for losing her honour over Juan. Juan has a
seductive manner because he never seems anxious to seduce. He neither
brooks nor claims superiority. Adeline advises Juan to get married, but
he acknowledges the women he is attracted to tend to be already married.
Adeline tries to deduce a suitable match for Juan, but intentionally
omits mention of the 16-year-old and enticing Aurora Raby, a Catholic.
Juan is attracted to her --- she is purer than the rest, and reminds him
of his lost Haidée. An elaborate dinner is described in detail. Juan is
seated between Adeline and Aurora. Aurora has little to say initially,
and thaws only a little during the dinner.

### Canto XVI {#canto_xvi}

Juan is smitten with the beautiful Aurora, and thinks of her on
retiring. At night, he walks into the hall, viewing the gallery of
paintings. He hears footsteps, and sees a monk in cowl and beads. He
wonders if it is a ghost, or just a dream. He does not see the monk\'s
face, though he passes and repasses several times. The next morning in
reaction to how pale Juan looks, Adeline turns pale herself, the Duchess
of Fitz-Fulke looks at Juan hard, and Aurora surveys him \"with a kind
of calm surprise\". Adeline wonders if he is ill, and Lord Henry guesses
that he might have seen the \"Black Friar\". He relates the story of the
\"spirit of these walls\" who used to be seen often but had not been
seen of late. Lord Henry, himself, had seen the Black Friar on his
honeymoon. Adeline offers to sing the story of the ghost, accompanying
it on her harp. Aurora remains silent, but Lady Fitz-Fulke appears
mischievous after the song. The narrator suggests that Adeline had sung
this to laugh Juan out of his dismay. Juan attempts to lift his spirits,
as the house bustles in preparation for another feast. Before that,
however, a pregnant country girl and other petitioners present
themselves to Lord Henry in his capacity as Justice of the Peace. At the
banquet, Juan is preoccupied with his thoughts again. When he glances at
Aurora, he catches a smile on her cheek, but is uncertain of its
meaning, since Aurora sits pale and only a little flushed. Adeline goes
about her duties as hostess, while the Duchess of Fitz-Fulke is very
much at ease. They retire for the evening. Juan thinks about Aurora, who
has reawakened feelings in him which had lately been lost. After going
back to his room, he hears the tiptoe of footsteps again, after sitting
around in expectation of the ghost. His doors open, and again it is the
sable Friar concealed in his solemn hood. He pursues the friar up
against a wall, and then suddenly notices that the \"ghost\" has sweet
breath, a straggling curl, red lips, pearls, and a glowing bust. As the
hood falls down, the \"friar\" is revealed to be the voluptuous Duchess
of Fitz-Fulke.

### Canto XVII {#canto_xvii}

A Canto that Byron failed to complete but added to in the run up to his
death, it lacks any narrative and only barely mentions the protagonist.
It is instead a response to his critics who object to his views on the
grounds that \"If you are right, then everybody\'s wrong!\". In his
defence, he lists many great people who have been considered outsiders
and revolutionaries including Martin Luther and Galileo. The Canto ends
on the brink of resuming the storyline from Canto The Sixteenth where
Don Juan was left in a \"tender moonlit situation\".

## Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland>

Chapter One -- Down the Rabbit Hole: Alice, a seven-year-old girl, is
feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder
sister. She then notices a talking, clothed White Rabbit with a pocket
watch run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole when suddenly she
falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes.
She finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit through, but
through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle
on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to
shrink too small to reach the key which she has left on the table. She
eats a cake with \"EAT ME\" written on it in currants as the chapter
closes. Chapter Two -- The Pool of Tears: Chapter Two opens with Alice
growing to such a tremendous size her head hits the ceiling. Alice is
unhappy and, as she cries, her tears flood the hallway. After shrinking
down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own
tears and meets a Mouse, who is swimming as well. She tries to make
small talk with him in elementary French (thinking he may be a French
mouse) but her opening gambit \"Où est ma chatte?\" (\"Where is my
cat?\") offends the mouse and he tries to escape her. Chapter Three --
The Caucus Race and a Long Tale: The sea of tears becomes crowded with
other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters.
Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among
them is how to get dry again. The Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on
William the Conqueror. A Dodo decides that the best thing to dry them
off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a
circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals
away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.
Chapter Four -- The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill: The White Rabbit appears
again in search of the Duchess\'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his
maidservant, Mary Ann, he orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve
them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from
it; immediately she starts growing again. The horrified Rabbit orders
his gardener, Bill the Lizard, to climb on the roof and go down the
chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered
to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn
into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.
Chapter Five -- Advice from a Caterpillar: Alice comes upon a mushroom
and sitting on it is a blue Caterpillar smoking a hookah. The
Caterpillar questions Alice and she admits to her current identity
crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem. Before crawling
away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will
make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off
two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than
ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a
pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings
herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and
uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.

Chapter Six -- Pig and Pepper: A Fish-Footman has an invitation for the
Duchess of the house, which he delivers to a Frog-Footman. Alice
observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the
frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess\'s Cook is throwing
dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice,
the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning Cheshire Cat) to
sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and to her
surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree,
directing her to the March Hare\'s house. He disappears but his grin
remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark
that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a
cat. Chapter Seven -- A Mad Tea-Party: Alice becomes a guest at a
\"mad\" tea party along with the March Hare, the Hatter, and a very
tired Dormouse who falls asleep frequently, only to be violently
awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters
give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \'Why is a
raven like a writing desk?\'. The Hatter reveals that they have tea all
day because Time has punished him by eternally standing still at 6 pm
(tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with
riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that
she had ever been to.

Chapter Eight -- The Queen\'s Croquet Ground: Alice leaves the tea party
and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards
painting the white roses on a rose tree red because The Queen of Hearts
hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even
the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen.
The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase
\"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction
with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a
game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game
quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and
hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The
Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her
executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that
can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is
prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.
Chapter Nine -- The Mock Turtle\'s Story: The Duchess is brought to the
croquet ground at Alice\'s request. She ruminates on finding morals in
everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat
of execution and she introduces Alice to the Gryphon, who takes her to
the Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no
sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle
in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.

Chapter Ten -- Lobster Quadrille: The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance
to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly)
\"\'Tis the Voice of the Lobster\". The Mock Turtle sings them
\"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an
impending trial. Chapter Eleven -- Who Stole the Tarts?: Alice attends a
trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen\'s
tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including Bill the
Lizard, the White Rabbit is the court\'s trumpeter, and the judge is the
King of Hearts. During the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily
growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right
to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and
calls the dormouse\'s accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and
she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the
Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect
answers to the questioning, and the Duchess\'s cook. Chapter Twelve --
Alice\'s Evidence: Alice is then called up as a witness. She
accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and
the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the
trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule
42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice
disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King
and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing
to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It\'s not that I was the one who
stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen
confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts
after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his
charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid,
calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a
time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her.
Alice\'s sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be
some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice\'s face. Alice
leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for
herself.

## Heart of Darkness (1899)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness>

Aboard the Nellie, anchored in the River Thames near Gravesend, Charles
Marlow tells his fellow sailors how he became captain of a river
steamboat for an ivory trading company. As a child, Marlow had been
fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly by the biggest,
which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into
\"a place of darkness\". Yet there remained a big river, \"resembling an
immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest
curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the
land\". The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow \"as a
snake would a bird\". Feeling as though \"instead of going to the centre
of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth\",
Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and
then into the interior. After more than thirty days the ship anchors off
the seat of government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with 200
mi (320 km) to go yet, takes passage on a little sea-going steamer
captained by a Swede. He departs some 30 mi (48 km) up the river where
his company\'s station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving
removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to
stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in \"the gloomy
circle of some Inferno\": the place is full of diseased Africans who
worked on the railroad and now lay sick and gaunt, awaiting death.
Marlow witnesses the scene \"horror-struck.\" Marlow must wait for ten
days in the company\'s Outer Station. He sleeps in a hut. At this
station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the
company\'s impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a Mr.
Kurtz, who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely
respected, first-class agent, a \"\'very remarkable person\'\" who
\"\'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together\'\". The agent
predicts that Kurtz will go very far: \"\'He will be a somebody in the
Administration before long. They, above---the Council in Europe, you
know---mean him to be\'\".

Marlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot about 200
miles (320 km) into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the
steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his
march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees and is
shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat has been
wrecked in an accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager,
who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive,
because the up-river stations had to be relieved and tells him of a
rumour that one important station is in jeopardy because its chief, the
exceptional Mr. Kurtz, is ill. \"Hang Kurtz\", Marlow thinks, irritated.
He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for
some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of
materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is
tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room
of the station\'s brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for
material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to
pump him and is curious to know what kind of information he is after.
Hanging on the wall is \"a small sketch in oils, on a panel,
representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch\".
Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the
woman\'s face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the
station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz \"\'a prodigy\'\" and
\"\'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress\'\", and feels Kurtz
represents the \"\'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of
purpose\'\" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with. The
man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then
makes the connection to Marlow: \"\'The same people who sent him
specially also recommended you\'\". Marlow is frustrated by the months
it takes to perform the repairs, delayed by the lack of proper tools and
replacement parts at the station. He learns that Kurtz is not admired
but rather resented by the manager. Once underway, the journey up-river
to Kurtz\'s station takes two months. The steamboat stops briefly near
an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and
a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed
quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.

The journey pauses for the night about 8 miles (13 km) below the Inner
Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is
enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud
cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe
navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked
with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled
by a spear and falls at Marlow\'s feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle
repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows
to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow\'s word for the European
hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward,
Marlow notes that the International Society for the Suppression of
Savage Customs had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did
eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz,
reads \"Exterminate all the brutes!\" At Kurtz\'s station Marlow sees a
man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims,
heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz.
The man from the bank boards the steamboat and turns out to be a Russian
wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz\'s camp. He explains that
he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through
conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the
natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian
admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life and
justice and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his
mind and seems to admire him even for his power---and for his
willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz
has gone mad. From the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail
and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped
with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the
manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz
on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently
ready for battle but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher and the
natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer
and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a
private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in
measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer; literary
commentators say she is Kurtz\'s mistress. When the manager exits the
cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the
company\'s business in the region, that his methods are \"unsound\".
Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the company wants to
remove him from the station and kill him and Marlow confirms that
hangings had been discussed.

After midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the
steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak
Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to
call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he
raises an alarm but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more
in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the
river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again
assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the
pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle
repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains
unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current
carries them swiftly downstream. Kurtz\'s health worsens on the return
trip and Marlow becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and
while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers,
including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep
them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is
near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper \"The horror!
The horror!\". A short while later, the \"manager\'s boy\" announces to
the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, \"Mistah Kurtz---he dead\" .
The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury
\"something\" in a muddy hole. He falls very ill, himself near death.
Upon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the
\"civilised\" world. Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had
entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows
they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz\'s report to a journalist,
for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some
personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz\'s fiancée, whom Kurtz
referred to as \"My Intended\". When Marlow visits her, she is dressed
in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a
year since Kurtz\'s death. She presses Marlow for information, asking
him to repeat Kurtz\'s final words. Uncomfortably, Marlow lies and tells
her that Kurtz\'s final word was her name.


## Lord Jim (1900)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Jim>

Recovered from an injury, Jim seeks a position on the Patna, a steamer
serving the transport of 800 \"pilgrims of an exacting belief\" to a
port on the Red Sea. He is hired as first mate. After some days of
smooth sailing, the ship hits something in the night and begins taking
on water. The captain thinks the ship will sink, and Jim agrees, but
wants to put the passengers on the few boats before that can happen. The
captain and two other crewmen think only to save themselves, and prepare
to lower a boat. The helmsmen remain, as no order has been given to do
otherwise. In a crucial moment, Jim jumps into the boat with the
captain. A few days later, they are picked up by an outbound steamer.
When they reach port, they learn that the Patna and its passengers were
brought in safely by a crew from a French navy ship. The captain\'s
actions in abandoning both ship and passengers are against the code of
seamen and the crew is publicly vilified. When the other men leave town
before the magistrate\'s court can be convened, Jim is the only crew
member left to testify. All lose their certificates to sail. Brierly, a
captain of perfect reputation who is on the panel of the court, commits
suicide days after the trial. Captain Charles Marlow attends the trial
and meets Jim, whose behavior he condemns, but the young man intrigues
him. Wracked with guilt, Jim confesses his shame to Marlow, who finds
him a place to live in a friend\'s home. Jim is accepted there but
leaves abruptly when an engineer who had also abandoned the ship appears
to work at the house. Jim then finds work as a ship chandler\'s clerk in
ports of the East Indies, always succeeding in the job then leaving
abruptly when the Patna is mentioned. In Bangkok, he gets in a
fistfight. Marlow realises that Jim needs a new situation, something
that will take him far away from modern ports and keep him occupied so
that he can finally forget his guilt. Marlow consults his friend Stein,
who sees that Jim is a romantic and considers his situation. Stein
offers Jim to be his trade representative or factor in Patusan, a
village on a remote island shut off from most commerce, which Jim finds
to be exactly what he needs. After his initial challenge of entering the
settlement of native Malay and Bugis people, Jim manages to earn their
respect by relieving them of the depredations of the bandit Sherif Ali
and protecting them from the corrupt local Malay chief, Rajah Tunku
Allang. He builds a solid link with Doramin, the Bugis friend of Stein,
and his son Dain Waris. For his leadership, the people call him \"tuan
Jim\", or Lord Jim. Jim also wins the love of Jewel, a young woman of
mixed race, and is \"satisfied\... nearly\". Marlow visits Patusan once,
two years after Jim arrived there, and sees his success. Jewel does not
believe that Jim will stay, as her father left her mother, and she is
not reassured that Marlow or any other will not arrive to take him from
her. Her mother had been married before her death to Cornelius,
previously given the factor\'s role by Stein for her benefit. Cornelius
is a lazy, jealous, and brutal man who treats his stepdaughter cruelly
and steals the supplies Stein sends for sale; he is displaced by Jim\'s
arrival and resents him for it. \"Gentleman\" Brown, a marauder captain
notorious for his evil ways, then arrives in Patusan, his small crew on
the brink of starvation. The local defence led by Dain Waris manages to
prevent the marauders from looting the village and holds them entrenched
in place while Jim is away in the island\'s interior. When Jim returns,
Brown deceptively wins Jim\'s mercy, who hesitantly negotiates to allow
them to leave Patusan unobstructed, but reminds Brown that the long
passage down river to the sea will be guarded by armed men. Cornelius
sees his chance to get rid of Jim. He tells Brown of a side channel that
will bypass most of the defenses, which Brown uses, stopping briefly to
ambush the defenders he finds. Dain Waris is killed among others, and
Brown sails on, leaving Cornelius behind; Jim\'s man Tamb\' Itam kills
Cornelius for his betrayal. Jim is mortified when he receives word of
the death of his good friend, and resolves to leave Patusan. Jewel, who
had wanted Jim to attack Brown and his ship, is distraught. Jim then
goes directly to Doramin and takes responsibility for the death of his
only son. Doramin uses his flintlock pistols, given him by Stein, to
shoot Jim in the chest. On his regular route, Marlow arrives at Stein\'s
house a few days after this event, finding Jewel and Tamb\' Itam there,
and tries to make sense of what happened. Jewel stays in Stein\'s house.


## Nostromo (1904)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostromo>

Nostromo is set in the South American country of Costaguana, and more
specifically in that country\'s Occidental Province and its port city of
Sulaco. Though Costaguana is a fictional nation, its geography as
described in the book resembles real-life Colombia. Costaguana has a
long history of tyranny, revolution and warfare, but has recently
experienced a period of stability under the dictator Ribiera. Charles
Gould is a native Costaguanero of English descent who owns an important
silver-mining concession near the key port of Sulaco. He is tired of the
political instability in Costaguana and its concomitant corruption, and
uses his wealth to support Ribiera\'s government, which he believes will
finally bring stability to the country after years of misrule and
tyranny by self-serving dictators. Instead, Gould\'s refurbished silver
mine and the wealth it has generated inspires a new round of revolutions
and self-proclaimed warlords, plunging Costaguana into chaos. Among
others, the forces of the revolutionary General Montero invade Sulaco
after securing the inland capital; Gould, adamant that his silver should
not become spoil for his enemies, orders Nostromo, the trusted \"Capataz
de Cargadores\" (Head Longshoreman) of Sulaco, to take it offshore so it
can be sold into international markets. Nostromo is an Italian
expatriate who has risen to his position through his bravery and daring
exploits. (\"Nostromo\" is Italian for \"shipmate\" or \"boatswain\",
but the name could also be considered a corruption of the Italian phrase
\"nostro uomo\" or \"nostr\'uomo\", meaning \"our man\"). Nostromo\'s
real name is Giovanni Battista Fidanza---Fidanza meaning \"trust\" in
archaic Italian. Nostromo is a commanding figure in Sulaco, respected by
the wealthy Europeans and seemingly limitless in his abilities to
command power among the local population. He is, however, never admitted
to become a part of upper-class society, but is instead viewed by the
rich as their useful tool. He is believed by Charles Gould and his own
employers to be incorruptible, and it is for this reason that Nostromo
is entrusted with removing the silver from Sulaco to keep it from the
revolutionaries. Accompanied by the young journalist Martin Decoud,
Nostromo sets off to smuggle the silver out of Sulaco. However, the
lighter on which the silver is being transported is struck at night in
the waters off Sulaco by a transport carrying the invading revolutionary
forces under the command of Colonel Sotillo. Nostromo and Decoud manage
to save the silver by putting the lighter ashore on Great Isabel. Decoud
and the silver are deposited on the deserted island of Great Isabel in
the expansive bay off Sulaco, while Nostromo scuttles the lighter and
manages to swim back to shore undetected. Back in Sulaco, Nostromo\'s
power and fame continues to grow as he daringly rides over the mountains
to summon the army which ultimately saves Sulaco\'s powerful leaders
from the revolutionaries and ushers in the independent state of Sulaco.
In the meantime, left alone on the deserted island, Decoud eventually
loses his mind. He takes the small lifeboat out to sea and there shoots
himself, after first weighing his body down with some of the silver
ingots so that he would sink into the sea. His exploits during the
revolution do not bring Nostromo the fame he had hoped for, and he feels
slighted and used. Feeling that he has risked his life for nothing, he
is consumed by resentment, which leads to his corruption and ultimate
destruction, for he has kept secret the true fate of the silver after
all others believed it lost at sea. He finds himself becoming a slave of
the silver and its secret, even as he slowly recovers it ingot by ingot
during nighttime trips to Great Isabel. The fate of Decoud is a mystery
to Nostromo, which combined with the fact of the missing silver ingots
only adds to his paranoia. Eventually a lighthouse is constructed on
Great Isabel, threatening Nostromo\'s ability to recover the treasure in
secret. The ever resourceful Nostromo manages to have a close
acquaintance, the widower Giorgio Viola, named as its keeper. Nostromo
is in love with Giorgio\'s younger daughter, but ultimately becomes
engaged to his elder daughter Linda. One night while attempting to
recover more of the silver, Nostromo is shot and killed, mistaken for a
trespasser by old Giorgio.

## The Brothers Karamazov (1880)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov>

Book One: A Nice Little Family

The opening of the novel introduces the Karamazov family and relates the
story of their distant and recent past. The details of Fyodor\'s two
marriages as well as his indifference to the upbringing of his three
children is chronicled. The narrator also establishes the widely varying
personalities of the three brothers and the circumstances that have led
to their return to Fyodor\'s town. The first book concludes by
describing the mysterious religious order of Elders to which Alyosha has
become devoted.Book Two: An Inappropriate Gathering

Book Two begins as the Karamazov family arrives at the local monastery
so that the Elder Zosima can act as a mediator between Dmitri and his
father Fyodor in their dispute over Dmitri\'s inheritance. It was the
father\'s idea, apparently as a joke, to have the meeting take place in
such a holy place in the presence of the famous Elder. Dmitri arrives
late and the gathering soon degenerates and only exacerbates the feud
between Dmitri and Fyodor. This book also contains a scene in which the
Elder Zosima consoles a woman mourning the death of her three-year-old
son. The poor woman\'s grief parallels Dostoyevsky\'s own tragedy at the
loss of his young son Alyosha.Book Three: Sensualists

The third book provides more details of the love triangle that has
erupted between Fyodor, his son Dmitri, and Grushenka. Dmitri\'s
personality is explored in the conversation between him and Alyosha as
Dmitri hides near his father\'s home to see if Grushenka will arrive.
Later that evening, Dmitri bursts into his father\'s house and assaults
him while threatening to come back and kill him in the future. This book
also introduces Smerdyakov and his origins, as well as the story of his
mother, Reeking Lizaveta. At the conclusion of this book, Alyosha is
witness to Grushenka\'s bitter humiliation of Dmitri\'s betrothed
Katerina, resulting in terrible embarrassment and scandal for this proud
woman.Book Four: Lacerations/Strains

This section introduces a side story which resurfaces in more detail
later in the novel. It begins with Alyosha observing a group of
schoolboys throwing rocks at one of their sickly peers named Ilyusha.
When Alyosha admonishes the boys and tries to help, Ilyusha bites
Alyosha\'s finger. It is later learned that Ilyusha\'s father, a former
staff-captain named Snegiryov, was assaulted by Dmitri, who dragged him
by the beard out of a bar. Alyosha soon learns of the further hardships
present in the Snegiryov household and offers the former staff captain
money as an apology for his brother and to help Snegiryov\'s ailing wife
and children. After initially accepting the money with joy, Snegiryov
throws the money back at Alyosha out of pride and runs back into his
home.Book Five: Pro and Contra

Here, the rationalist and nihilistic ideology that permeated Russia at
this time is defended and espoused passionately by Ivan Karamazov while
meeting his brother Alyosha at a restaurant. In the chapter titled
\"Rebellion\", Ivan proclaims that he rejects the world that God has
created because it is built on a foundation of suffering. In perhaps the
most famous chapter in the novel, \"The Grand Inquisitor\", Ivan
narrates to Alyosha his imagined poem that describes a leader from the
Spanish Inquisition and his encounter with Jesus, Who has made His
return to earth. The opposition between reason and faith is dramatised
and symbolised in forceful monologue of the Grand Inquisitor who, having
ordered Jesus arrested, visits Him in prison at night. Why hast Thou
come now to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou knowest
that\... We are working not with Thee but with him \[Satan\]\... We took
from him what Thou didst reject with scorn, that last gift he offered
Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of the earth. We took from him Rome
and the sword of Caesar, and proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the
earth\... We shall triumph and shall be Caesars, and then we shall plan
the universal happiness of man. The Grand Inquisitor accuses Jesus of
having inflicted on humankind the \"burden\" of free will. At the end of
all these arguments, Jesus silently steps forward and kisses the old man
on his lips. The Grand Inquisitor, stunned and moved, tells Him he must
never come there again, and lets Him out. Alyosha, after hearing this
story, goes to Ivan and kisses him softly, with an unexplainable
emotion, on the lips. Ivan shouts with delight, because Alyosha\'s
gesture is taken directly from his poem. The brothers then part.Book
Six: The Russian Monk

The sixth book relates the life and history of the Elder Zosima as he
lies near death in his cell. Zosima explains he found his faith in his
rebellious youth, in the middle of a duel, consequently deciding to
become a monk. Zosima preaches people must forgive others by
acknowledging their own sins and guilt before others. He explains that
no sin is isolated, making everyone responsible for their neighbor\'s
sins. Zosima represents a philosophy that responds to Ivan\'s, which had
challenged God\'s creation in the previous book.Book Seven: Alyosha

The book begins immediately following the death of Zosima. It is a
commonly held perception in the town, and the monastery as well, that
true holy men\'s bodies are incorrupt, i.e., they do not succumb to
putrefaction. Thus, the expectation concerning the Elder Zosima is that
his deceased body will not decompose. It comes as a great shock to the
entire town that Zosima\'s body not only decays, but begins the process
almost immediately following his death. Within the first day, the smell
of Zosima\'s body is already unbearable. For many this calls into
question their previous respect and admiration for Zosima. Alyosha is
particularly devastated by the sullying of Zosima\'s name due to nothing
more than the corruption of his dead body. One of Alyosha\'s companions
in the monastery named Rakitin uses Alyosha\'s vulnerability to set up a
meeting between him and Grushenka. However, instead of Alyosha becoming
corrupted, he is able to earn fresh faith and hope from Grushenka, while
Grushenka\'s troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption
through his influence: they become close friends. The book ends with the
spiritual regeneration of Alyosha as he embraces, kisses the earth
outside the monastery (echoing, perhaps, Zosima\'s last earthly act
before his death) and cries convulsively until finally going back out
into the world, as Zosima instructed, renewed.Book Eight: Mitya

This section deals primarily with Dmitri\'s wild and distraught pursuit
of money so he can run away with Grushenka. Dmitri owes money to his
fiancée Katerina and will believe himself to be a thief if he does not
find the money to pay her back before embarking on his quest for
Grushenka. This mad dash for money takes Dmitri from Grushenka\'s
benefactor to a neighboring town on a fabricated promise of a business
deal. All the while Dmitri is petrified that Grushenka may go to his
father Fyodor and marry him because he already has the monetary means to
satisfy her. When Dmitri returns from his failed dealing in the
neighboring town, he escorts Grushenka to her benefactor\'s home, but
quickly discovers she deceived him and left early. Furious, he runs to
his father\'s home with a brass pestle in his hand, and spies on him
from the window. He takes the pestle from his pocket. Then, there is a
discontinuity in the action, and Dmitri is suddenly running away off his
father\'s property, knocking the servant Gregory in the head with the
pestle with seemingly fatal results.Dmitri is next seen in a daze on the
street, covered in blood, with a pile of money in his hand. He soon
learns that Grushenka\'s former betrothed has returned and taken her to
a lodge near where Dmitri just was. Upon learning this, Dmitri loads a
cart full of food and wine and pays for a huge orgy to finally confront
Grushenka in the presence of her old flame, intending all the while to
kill himself at dawn. The \"first and rightful lover\", however, is a
boorish Pole who cheats the party at a game of cards. When his deception
is revealed, he flees, and Grushenka soon reveals to Dmitri that she
really is in love with him. The party rages on, and just as Dmitri and
Grushenka are making plans to marry, the police enter the lodge and
inform Dmitri that he is under arrest for the murder of his father.Book
Nine: The Preliminary Investigation

Book Nine introduces the details of Fyodor\'s murder and describes the
interrogation of Dmitri as he is questioned for the crime he maintains
he did not commit. The alleged motive for the crime is robbery. Dmitri
was known to have been completely destitute earlier that evening, but is
suddenly seen on the street with thousands of rubles shortly after his
father\'s murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor
Karamazov had set aside for Grushenka has disappeared. Dmitri explains
that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles
Katerina gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first
meeting with Grushenka---another drunken orgy---and sewed up the rest in
a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina in the name of honor, he
says. The lawyers are not convinced by this. All of the evidence points
against Dmitri; the only other person in the house at the time of the
murder was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure
he apparently suffered the day before. As a result of the overwhelming
evidence against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the patricide and
taken away to prison to await trial.Book Ten: Boys

Boys continues the story of the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to
in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy
Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism,
socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. He seems destined to
follow in the spiritual footsteps of Ivan Karamazov; Dostoyevsky uses
Kolya\'s beliefs especially in a conversation with Alyosha to poke fun
at his Westernizer critics by putting their beliefs in what appears to
be a young boy who doesn\'t exactly know what he is talking about. Kolya
is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself
in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a
train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All
the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative
left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and
the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a
falling out over Ilyusha\'s maltreatment of a dog: Ilyusha had fed it
bread in which there was a pin on Smerdyakov\'s suggestion. But thanks
to Alyosha\'s intervention the other schoolboys have gradually
reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is
here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist
beliefs.Book Eleven: Brother Ivan Fyodorovich

Book Eleven chronicles Ivan Karamazov\'s destructive influence on those
around him and his descent into madness. It is in this book that Ivan
meets three times with Smerdyakov, the final meeting culminating in
Smerdyakov\'s dramatic confession that he had faked the fit, murdered
Fyodor Karamazov, and stolen the money, which he presents to Ivan.
Smerdyakov expresses disbelief at Ivan\'s professed ignorance and
surprise. Smerdyakov claims that Ivan was complicit in the murder by
telling Smerdyakov when he would be leaving Fyodor\'s house, and more
importantly by instilling in Smerdyakov the belief that in a world
without God \"everything is permitted.\" The book ends with Ivan having
a hallucination in which he is visited by the devil, who torments Ivan
by mocking his beliefs. Alyosha finds Ivan raving and informs him that
Smerdyakov killed himself shortly after their final meeting.Book Twelve:
A Judicial Error

This book details the trial of Dmitri Karamazov for the murder of his
father Fyodor. The courtroom drama is sharply satirized by Dostoyevsky.
The men in the crowd are presented as resentful and spiteful, and the
women are irrationally drawn to the romanticism of Dmitri\'s love
triangle with Katerina and Grushenka. Ivan\'s madness takes its final
hold over him and he is carried away from the courtroom after recounting
his final meeting with Smerdyakov and the aforementioned confession. The
turning point in the trial is Katerina\'s damning testimony against
Dmitri. Impassioned by Ivan\'s illness which she believes is a result of
her assumed love for Dmitri, she produces a letter drunkenly written by
Dmitri saying that he would kill Fyodor. The section concludes with the
impassioned closing remarks of the prosecutor and the defense, and the
verdict that Dmitri is guilty.Epilogue

The final section opens with discussion of a plan developed for
Dmitri\'s escape from his sentence of twenty years of hard labor in
Siberia. The plan is never fully described, but it seems to involve Ivan
and Katerina bribing some guards. Alyosha approves, first, because
Dmitri is not emotionally ready to submit to such a harsh sentence,
secondly, because he is innocent, and, third, because no guards or
officers would suffer for aiding the escape. Dmitri and Grushenka plan
to escape to America and work the land there for several years, and then
to return to Russia under assumed American names, because they both
cannot imagine living without Russia. Dmitri begs for Katerina to visit
him in the hospital, where he is recovering from an illness before he is
due to be taken away. When she does, Dmitri apologizes for having hurt
her; she in turn apologizes for bringing up the implicating letter
during the trial. They agree to love each other for that one moment, and
say they will love each other forever, even though both now love other
people. The novel concludes at Ilyusha\'s funeral, where Ilyusha\'s
schoolboy friends listen to Alyosha\'s \"Speech by the Stone\". Alyosha
promises to remember Kolya, Ilyusha, and all the boys and keep them
close in his heart, even though he will have to leave them and may not
see them again until many years have passed. He implores them to love
each other and to always remember Ilyusha, and to keep his memory alive
in their hearts, and to remember this moment at the stone when they were
all together and they all loved each other. Alyosha then recounts the
Christian promise that they will all be united one day after the
Resurrection. In tears, the twelve boys promise Alyosha that they will
keep each other in their memories forever, join hands, and return to the
Snegiryov household for the funeral dinner, chanting, \"Hurrah for
Karamazov!\"

## A Study in Scarlet (1887)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet>

### Part I: The Reminiscences of Watson {#part_i_the_reminiscences_of_watson}

Part I leads with a heading which establishes the role of Dr. John
Watson as narrator and sets up the narrative stand-point that the work
to follow is not fiction, but fact: \"Being a Reprint from the
Reminiscences of John H. Watson, MD, Late of the Army Medical
Department.\" The story begins in 1881, when Watson, having returned to
London after serving in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, visits the
Criterion Restaurant and runs into an old friend named Stamford, who had
been a dresser under him at St. Bartholomew\'s Hospital. Watson confides
in Stamford that, due to a shoulder injury that he sustained at the
Battle of Maiwand, he has been forced to leave the armed services and is
now looking for a place to live-before his six-month half-pay pension
runs out. Stamford mentions that an acquaintance of his, Sherlock
Holmes, is looking for someone to split the rent at a flat at 221B Baker
Street, but he cautions Watson about Holmes\'s eccentricities. Stamford
takes Watson back to St. Bartholomew\'s where, in a laboratory, they
find Holmes experimenting with a reagent, seeking a test to detect human
hemoglobin. Holmes explains the significance of bloodstains as evidence
in criminal trials. After Stamford introduces Watson to Holmes, Holmes
shakes Watson\'s hand and comments, \"You have been in Afghanistan, I
perceive.\" Though Holmes chooses not to explain why he made the
comment, Watson raises the subject of their parallel quests for a place
to live in London, and Holmes explains that he has found the perfect
place in Baker Street. At Holmes\'s prompting, the two review their
various shortcomings to make sure that they can live together. After
seeing the rooms at 221B, they move in and grow accustomed to their new
situation. Watson is amazed by Holmes, who has a profound knowledge of
chemistry and sensational literature, very precise but narrow knowledge
of geology and botany; yet knows little about literature, astronomy,
philosophy, and politics. Holmes also has multiple guests visiting him
at different intervals during the day. After much speculation by Watson,
Holmes reveals that he is a \"consulting detective\" and that the guests
are clients. Facing Watson\'s doubts about some of his claims, Holmes
casually deduces to Watson that one visitor, a messenger from Scotland
Yard is also a retired Marine sergeant. When the man confirms this,
Watson is astounded by Holmes\' ability to notice details, assemble
them, and draw conclusions. Holmes reads the telegram requesting a
consultation in a fresh murder case. He is reluctant to help because
credit would go entirely to the officials. Watson urges him to
reconsider so Holmes invites him to accompany him as he investigates the
crime scene, an abandoned house off the Brixton Road.

Holmes observes the pavement and garden leading up to the house before
he and Watson meet Inspectors Gregson and Lestrade. The four observe the
crime scene, Holmes using a magnifying lens and tape measure. The male
corpse, he\'s told, has been identified as a very wealthy man named
Enoch Drebber. Blood has been found in the room but there is no wound on
the body. They also learn from documents found on his person that he was
in London with his secretary, Joseph Stangerson. On one wall, written in
blood, is \"RACHE\". Correcting an erroneous theory of Lestrade\'s,
Holmes remarks that it is the German word for \"revenge.\" He goes on to
deduce that the victim died from poison and supplies a description of
the murderer: six feet tall, disproportionately small feet, florid
complexion, square-toed boots and smoking a Trichinopoly cigar. His
right-hand fingernails are long and he arrived in a cab whose horse had
three old shoes and one new one. Holmes says \"RACHE\" was a ploy to
fool the police. Upon moving Drebber\'s body, the pair discovers a
woman\'s gold wedding ring. Soon, Holmes and Watson visit the home of
the constable who had first discovered the corpse, paying him a bit for
the disturbance. They get little information Holmes didn\'t already
know, other than that a seemingly drunk loiterer had attempted to
approach the crime scene. Holmes chastises the officer for not realizing
that this was the murderer himself in disguise. They leave and Holmes
explains that the murderer returned on realizing that he\'d forgotten
the wedding ring. Holmes dispatches some telegrams including an order
for a newspaper notice about the ring. He also buys a facsimile of it.
He guesses that the murderer, having already returned to the scene of
the crime for it, would come to retrieve it. The advertisement is
answered by an old woman who claims that the ring belongs to her
daughter. Holmes gives her the duplicate, follows her, and returns to
Watson with the story: she took a cab, he hopped onto the back of it, he
found that she had vanished when it stopped. This leads Holmes to
believe that it was the murderer\'s accomplice in disguise. A day later,
Gregson visits Holmes and Watson, telling them that he has arrested a
suspect. He had gone to Madame Charpentier\'s Boarding House where
Drebber and Stangerson had stayed before the murder. He learned from her
that Drebber, a drunk, had attempted to kiss Mrs. Charpentier\'s
daughter, Alice, which caused their immediate eviction. Drebber,
however, came back later that night and attempted to grab Alice,
prompting her older brother to attack him. He attempted to chase Drebber
with a cudgel but claimed to have lost sight of him. Gregson has him in
custody on this circumstantial evidence.

Lestrade then arrives revealing that Stangerson has been murdered.
Lestrade had gone to interview Stangerson after learning where he had
been rooming. His body was found dead near the hotel window, stabbed
through the heart. Above his body was written \"RACHE\". The only things
Stangerson had with him were a novel, a pipe, a telegram saying \"J.H.
Is in Europe\", and a small box containing two pills. The pillbox
Lestrade still has with him. Holmes tests the pills on an old and sickly
Scottish terrier in residence at Baker Street. The first pill produces
no evident effect, but the second kills the terrier. Holmes deduces that
one was harmless and the other poison. Just at that moment, a very young
street urchin named Wiggins arrives. He is the leader of the Baker
Street Irregulars, a group of street children Holmes employs to help him
occasionally. Wiggins states that he\'s summoned the cab Holmes wanted.
Holmes sends him down to fetch the cabby, claiming to need help with his
luggage. When the cabby comes upstairs and bends for the trunk, Holmes
handcuffs and restrains him. He then announces the captive cabby as
Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson.

### Part II: \"The Country of the Saints\" {#part_ii_the_country_of_the_saints}

The story flashes back to the Salt Lake Valley in Utah in 1847, where
John Ferrier and a little girl named Lucy, the only survivors of a small
party of pioneers, lie down near a boulder to die from dehydration and
hunger. They are discovered by a large party of Latter-day Saints led by
Brigham Young. The Mormons rescue Ferrier and Lucy on the condition that
they adopt and live under their faith. Ferrier, who has proven himself
an able hunter, adopts Lucy and is given a generous land grant with
which to build his farm after the party constructs Salt Lake City. Years
later, a now-grown Lucy befriends and falls in love with a man named
Jefferson Hope. Lucy and Hope become engaged, with the ceremony
scheduled to take place after Hope\'s return from a two-month-long
journey for his job. However, Ferrier is visited by Young, who reveals
that it is against the religion for Lucy to marry Hope, a non-Mormon. He
states that Lucy should marry Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber---both
sons of members of the church\'s Council of Four---though Lucy may
choose which one. Ferrier and Lucy are given a month to decide. Ferrier,
who has sworn to never marry his daughter to a Mormon, immediately sends
out a word to Hope for help. When he is visited by Stangerson and
Drebber, Ferrier is angered by their arguments over Lucy and throws them
out. Every day, however, the number of days Ferrier has left to marry
off Lucy is painted somewhere on his farm in the middle of the night.
Hope finally arrives on the eve of the last day, and sneaks his love and
her adoptive father out of their farm and away from Salt Lake City.
However, while he is hunting for food, Hope returns to a horrific sight:
a makeshift grave for the elder Ferrier. Lucy is nowhere to be seen.
Determined to devote his life to revenge, Hope sneaks back into Salt
Lake City, learning that Stangerson murdered Ferrier and that Lucy was
forcibly married to Drebber. Lucy dies a month later from a broken
heart; Drebber, who inherited Ferrier\'s farm becomes wealthy after
converting the land to cash and is indifferent to Lucy\'s death. Hope
then breaks into Drebber\'s house the night before Lucy\'s funeral to
kiss her body and remove her wedding ring. Swearing vengeance, Hope
stalks the town, coming close to killing Drebber and Stangerson on
numerous occasions. Hope begins to suffer from an aortic aneurysm,
causing him to leave the mountains to earn money and recuperate. When he
returns several years later, he learns that Drebber and Stangerson have
fled Salt Lake City after a schism between the Mormons. Hope searches
the United States, eventually tracking them to Cleveland; Drebber has
Hope arrested as an old rival in love; released from jail Hope finds
that the pair then flees to Europe, where for a month he stays on their
trail (St. Petersburg, Russia; Copenhagen, Denmark; Paris, France)
eventually landing in London. This is the story the handcuffed Hope
willingly tells to Holmes, Lestrade, Gregson, and Watson. In London,
Hope became a cabby and eventually found Drebber and Stangerson at the
train station in Euston about to depart to Liverpool for the United
States. Having missed the first train, Drebber instructed Stangerson to
wait at the station and then returned to Madame Charpentier\'s house.
After an altercation with Madame Charpentier\'s son, Drebber got into
Hope\'s cab and spent several hours drinking. Eventually, Hope took him
to the house on Brixton Road, which Drebber drunkenly entered believing
it was a hotel. Hope then forced Drebber to recognize him and to choose
between two pills, one of which was harmless and the other poison.
Drebber took the poisoned pill, and as he died, Hope showed him Lucy\'s
wedding ring. The excitement coupled with his aneurysm had caused his
nose to bleed; he used the blood to write \"RACHE\" on the wall above
Drebber to confound the investigators. Hope realized, upon returning to
his cab, that he had forgotten Lucy\'s ring, but upon returning to the
house, he found Constable Rance and other police officers, whom he
evaded by acting drunk. He then had a friend pose as an old lady to pick
up the supposed ring from Holmes\'s advertisement. Hope then began
stalking Stangerson\'s room at the hotel; but Stangerson, on learning of
Drebber\'s murder, refused to come out. Hope climbed into the room
through the window and gave Stangerson the same choice of pills, but he
was attacked and nearly strangled by Stangerson and forced to stab him
in the heart. He has stayed in London only to earn enough money to go
back to the United States, although he admits that after twenty years of
vengeance, he now has nothing to live for or care about. After being
told of this, Holmes and Watson return to Baker Street; Hope dies from
his aneurysm the night before he is to appear in court, a smile on his
face. One morning, Holmes reveals to Watson how he had deduced the
identity of the murderer \[Using the one clue of the wedding ring, he
had deduced the name from a Telegram to the Cleveland Police regarding
Drebber\'s marriage\] and how he had used the Irregulars, whom he calls
\"street Arabs,\" to search for a cabby by that name. He then shows
Watson the newspaper; Lestrade and Gregson are given full credit.
Outraged, Watson states that Holmes should record the adventure and
publish it. Upon Holmes\'s refusal, Watson decides to do it himself.

## Invisible Man (1952)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Man>

The narrator, an unnamed black man, begins by describing his living
conditions: an underground room wired with hundreds of electric lights,
operated by power stolen from the city\'s electric grid. He reflects on
the various ways in which he has experienced social invisibility during
his life and begins to tell his story, returning to his teenage years.
The narrator lives in a small Southern town and, upon graduating from
high school, wins a scholarship to an all-black college. However, to
receive it, he must first take part in a brutal, humiliating battle
royal for the entertainment of the town\'s rich white dignitaries. One
afternoon during his junior year at the college, the narrator chauffeurs
Mr. Norton, a visiting rich white trustee, out among the old
slave-quarters beyond the campus. By chance, he stops at the cabin of
Jim Trueblood, who has caused a scandal by impregnating both his wife
and his daughter in his sleep. Trueblood\'s account horrifies Mr. Norton
so badly that he asks the narrator to find him a drink. The narrator
drives him to a bar filled with prostitutes and patients from a nearby
mental hospital. The mental patients rail against both of them and
eventually overwhelm the orderly assigned to keep the patients under
control. The narrator hurries an injured Mr. Norton away from the
chaotic scene and back to campus. Dr. Bledsoe, the college president,
excoriates the narrator for showing Mr. Norton the underside of black
life beyond the campus and expels him. However, Bledsoe gives several
sealed letters of recommendation to the narrator, to be delivered to
friends of the college in order to assist him in finding a job so that
he may eventually re-enroll. The narrator travels to New York and
distributes his letters, with no success; the son of one recipient shows
him the letter, which reveals Bledsoe\'s intent to never admit the
narrator as a student again. Acting on the son\'s suggestion, the
narrator seeks work at the Liberty Paint factory, renowned for its pure
white paint. He is assigned first to the shipping department, then to
the boiler room, whose chief attendant, Lucius Brockway, is highly
paranoid and suspects that the narrator is trying to take his job. This
distrust worsens after the narrator stumbles into a union meeting, and
Brockway attacks the narrator and tricks him into setting off an
explosion in the boiler room. The narrator is hospitalized and subjected
to shock treatment, overhearing the doctors\' discussion of him as a
possible mental patient. After leaving the hospital, the narrator faints
on the streets of Harlem and is taken in by Mary Rambo, a kindly
old-fashioned woman who reminds him of his relatives in the South. He
later happens across the eviction of an elderly black couple and makes
an impassioned speech that incites the crowd to attack the law
enforcement officials in charge of the proceedings. The narrator escapes
over the rooftops and is confronted by Brother Jack, the leader of a
group known as \"the Brotherhood\" that professes its commitment to
bettering conditions in Harlem and the rest of the world. At Jack\'s
urging, the narrator agrees to join and speak at rallies to spread the
word among the black community. Using his new salary, he pays Mary back
the rent he owes her and moves into an apartment provided by the
Brotherhood. The rallies go smoothly at first, with the narrator
receiving extensive indoctrination on the Brotherhood\'s ideology and
methods. Soon, though, he encounters trouble from Ras the Exhorter, a
fanatical black nationalist who believes that the Brotherhood is
controlled by whites. Neither the narrator nor Tod Clifton, a youth
leader within the Brotherhood, is particularly swayed by his words. The
narrator is later called before a meeting of the Brotherhood and accused
of putting his own ambitions ahead of the group. He is reassigned to
another part of the city to address issues concerning women, seduced by
the wife of a Brotherhood member, and eventually called back to Harlem
when Clifton is reported missing and the Brotherhood\'s membership and
influence begin to falter. The narrator can find no trace of Clifton at
first, but soon discovers him selling dancing Sambo dolls on the street,
having become disillusioned with the Brotherhood. Clifton is shot and
killed by a policeman while resisting arrest; at his funeral, the
narrator delivers a rousing speech that rallies the crowd to support the
Brotherhood again. At an emergency meeting, Jack and the other
Brotherhood leaders criticize the narrator for his unscientific
arguments and the narrator determines that the group has no real
interest in the black community\'s problems. The narrator returns to
Harlem, trailed by Ras\'s men, and buys a hat and a pair of sunglasses
to elude them. As a result, he is repeatedly mistaken for a man named
Rinehart, known as a lover, a hipster, a gambler, a briber, and a
spiritual leader. Understanding that Rinehart has adapted to white
society at the cost of his own identity, the narrator resolves to
undermine the Brotherhood by feeding them dishonest information
concerning the Harlem membership and situation. After seducing the wife
of one member in a fruitless attempt to learn their new activities, he
discovers that riots have broken out in Harlem due to widespread unrest.
He realizes that the Brotherhood has been counting on such an event in
order to further its own aims. The narrator gets mixed up with a gang of
looters, who burn down a tenement building, and wanders away from them
to find Ras, now on horseback, armed with a spear and shield, and
calling himself \"the Destroyer.\" Ras shouts for the crowd to lynch the
narrator, but the narrator attacks him with the spear and escapes into
an underground coal bin. Two white men seal him in, leaving him alone to
ponder the racism he has experienced in his life. The epilogue returns
to the present, with the narrator stating that he is ready to return to
the world because he has spent enough time hiding from it. He explains
that he has told his story in order to help people see past his own
invisibility, and also to provide a voice for people with a similar
plight: \"Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for
you?\"

## The Heart of the Matter (1948)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heart_of_the_Matter>

Major Scobie lives in a colony on the west coast of Africa during World
War II, and is responsible for local security during wartime. His wife
Louise, an unhappy, solitary woman who loves literature and poetry,
cannot make friends. Scobie feels responsible for her misery, but does
not love her. Their only child, Catherine, died in England several years
before. Louise is a devout Catholic. Scobie, a convert, is also devout.
Scobie is passed over for promotion to commissioner, which upsets Louise
both for her personal ambition and her hope that the local British
community will begin to accept her. Louise asks Scobie if she can go to
live in South Africa to escape a life she hates. At the same time, a new
inspector, named Wilson, arrives in the town. He is priggish and
socially inept, and hides his passion for poetry for fear of ostracism
by his colleagues. He and Louise strike up a friendship, which Wilson
mistakes for love. Wilson rooms with another colleague named Harris, who
has created a sport for himself of killing the cockroaches that appear
in his room each night. He invites Wilson to join him, but in the first
match, they end up quarreling over the rules of engagement. One of
Scobie\'s duties is to lead the inspections of local passenger ships,
particularly looking for smuggled diamonds, a needle-in-a-haystack
problem that never yields results. A Portuguese ship, the Esperança (the
Portuguese word for \'hope\'), comes into port, and a disgruntled
steward reveals the location of a letter hidden in the captain\'s
quarters. Scobie finds it, and because it is addressed to someone in
Germany, he confiscates as it might contain secret codes and clandestine
information. The captain says it\'s a letter to his daughter and begs
Scobie to forget the incident, offering him a bribe of one hundred
pounds when he learns that they share the Catholic faith. Scobie
declines the bribe and takes the letter, but having opened and read
it---contrary to regulations---and finding it innocuous, he decides not
to submit it to higher authorities, and burns it. Scobie is called to a
small inland town to deal with the suicide of the local inspector, a man
named Pemberton, who was in his early twenties and left a note implying
that his suicide was due to a loan he could not repay. Scobie suspects
the involvement of the local agent of a Syrian man named Yusef, a local
black marketeer. Yusef denies it, but warns Scobie that the British have
sent a new inspector specifically to look for diamonds; Scobie claims
this is a hoax and that he does not know of any such man. Scobie later
dreams that he is in Pemberton\'s situation, even writing a similar
note, but when he awakens, he tells himself that he could never commit
suicide, as no cause is worth the eternal damnation that suicide would
bring. Scobie tries to secure a loan from the bank to pay the two
hundred pound fare for Louise\'s passage, but is turned down. Yusef
offers to lend Scobie the money at four per cent per annum. Scobie
initially declines, but after an incident where he mistakenly thinks
Louise is contemplating suicide, he accepts the loan and sends Louise to
South Africa. Wilson meets them at the pier and tries to interfere with
their parting. Shortly afterwards, the survivors of a shipwreck arrive
after forty days at sea in lifeboats. One young girl dies as Scobie
tries to comfort her by pretending to be her father, who was killed in
the wreck. A 19-year-old woman named Helen Rolt also arrives
malnourished and dehydrated, clutching an album of postage stamps. She
was married before the ship left port and is now a widow with a wedding
ring too big for her finger. Scobie feels drawn to her, as much to the
cherished album of stamps as to her physical presence, even though she
is not beautiful. She reminds him of his daughter. He soon starts a
passionate affair with her, all the time aware that he is committing the
grave sin of adultery. A letter he writes to Helen ends up in Yusef\'s
hands, and the Syrian uses it to blackmail Scobie into sending a package
of diamonds for him via the departing Esperança, thus avoiding the
authorities. After Louise unexpectedly returns, Scobie struggles to keep
her ignorant of his love affair. But he is unable to renounce Helen,
even in the confessional, where the priest instructs him to think it
over and postpones absolution. Still, to placate his wife, Scobie
attends Mass with her and receives communion in his state of mortal
sin---a sacrilege according to Catholic doctrine. Soon after, Yusef\'s
servant delivers a \"gift\" to Scobie, which he refuses. Scobie\'s
servant, Ali, however, witnesses this and a romantic embrace between
Scobie and Helen. Scobie visits Yusef to confront him about the gift,
but also to relate his suspicion that Ali, whom he had trusted for all
of their 15 years together, is disloyal. Yusef says he will take care of
the matter, which within a few hours ends up with Ali being killed by
local teenagers known as \"wharf rats\". The reader is led to believe
that Yusef arranged the killing for which Scobie blames himself. Having
gone this far down the path of ruin and seeing no way out, Scobie
decides to free everyone from himself---including God---and plots his
death by faking a heart ailment and getting a prescription for sleeping
pills. Knowing full well that suicide is the ultimate damnation
according to Church doctrine, he proceeds in the end to commit suicide
with the pills. The act, however, yields ambiguous results. Helen
continues her dreary existence. And Louise, who knew about the affair
all along, is made to realize by her suitor, Wilson, that Scobie\'s
death was a suicide. She tells Wilson she will not marry him, but might
in time. The concluding chapter consists of a short encounter between
Louise and the confessional priest. Louise tries to rationalise
Scobie\'s suicide in relation to his Catholicism, to which the priest
advises that no one can know what\'s in a person\'s heart or about
God\'s mercy.

## Far from the Madding Crowd (1874)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_from_the_Madding_Crowd>

### Meeting, parting and reuniting {#meeting_parting_and_reuniting}

Gabriel Oak is a young shepherd. With the savings of a frugal life, and
a loan, he has leased and stocked a farm. He falls in love with a
newcomer eight years his junior, Bathsheba Everdene, a proud beauty who
arrives to live with her aunt. Over time, Bathsheba and Gabriel grow to
like each other well enough, and Bathsheba even saves his life once.
However, when he makes her an unadorned offer of marriage, she refuses;
she values her independence too much and him too little. After a few
days, she moves to Weatherbury, a village some miles off. When next they
meet, their circumstances have changed drastically. An inexperienced new
sheepdog drives Gabriel\'s flock over a cliff, ruining him. After
selling off everything of value, he manages to settle all his debts but
emerges penniless. He seeks employment at a hiring fair in the town of
Casterbridge. When he finds none, he heads to another such fair in
Shottsford, a town about ten miles from Weatherbury. On the way, he
happens upon a dangerous fire on a farm and leads the bystanders in
putting it out. When the veiled owner comes to thank him, he asks if she
needs a shepherd. She uncovers her face and reveals herself to be none
other than Bathsheba. She has recently inherited her uncle\'s estate and
is now wealthy. Though somewhat uncomfortable, she employs him.

### Bathsheba\'s valentine to Boldwood {#bathshebas_valentine_to_boldwood}

Meanwhile, Bathsheba gains a new admirer. William Boldwood is a
prosperous farmer of about 40, whose ardour Bathsheba unwittingly
awakens when she playfully sends him a valentine sealed with red wax on
which she has embossed the words \"Marry me\". Boldwood, not realising
the valentine was a jest, becomes obsessed with her and soon proposes
marriage. Although she does not love him, she toys with the idea of
accepting his offer; he is the most eligible bachelor in the district.
However, she avoids giving him a definite answer. When Gabriel rebukes
her for her thoughtlessness regarding Boldwood, she dismisses him. When
Bathsheba\'s sheep begin dying from bloat, she discovers to her chagrin
that Gabriel is the only man who knows how to cure them. Her pride
delays the inevitable, but finally she is forced to beg him for help.
Afterward, she offers him back his job, and their friendship is
restored.

### Sergeant Troy {#sergeant_troy}

At this point, the dashing Sergeant Francis \"Frank\" Troy returns to
his native Weatherbury and by chance encounters Bathsheba one night. Her
initial dislike turns to infatuation after he excites her with a private
display of swordsmanship. Gabriel observes Bathsheba\'s interest in the
young soldier and tries to discourage it, telling her she would be
better off marrying Boldwood. Boldwood becomes aggressive towards Troy,
and Bathsheba goes to Bath to prevent Troy returning to Weatherbury, as
she fears what might happen if Troy encountered Boldwood. On their
return, Boldwood offers his rival a large bribe to give up Bathsheba.
Troy pretends to consider the offer, then scornfully announces they are
already married. Boldwood withdraws, humiliated, and vows revenge.
Bathsheba soon discovers that her new husband is an improvident gambler
with little interest in farming. Worse, she begins to suspect he does
not love her. In fact, Troy\'s heart belongs to her former servant,
Fanny Robin. Before meeting Bathsheba, Troy had promised to marry Fanny;
on the wedding day, however, the luckless girl went to the wrong church.
She explained her mistake, but Troy, humiliated at being left at the
altar, angrily called off the wedding. When they parted, unbeknownst to
Troy, Fanny was pregnant with his child.

### Fanny Robin {#fanny_robin}

Some months later, Troy and Bathsheba encounter Fanny on the road,
destitute, as she painfully makes her way toward the Casterbridge
workhouse. Troy sends his wife onward, then gives Fanny all the money in
his pocket, telling her he will give her more in a few days. Fanny uses
up the last of her strength to reach her destination. A few hours later,
she dies in childbirth, along with the baby. Mother and child are then
placed in a coffin and sent home to Weatherbury for interment. Gabriel,
who knows of Troy\'s relationship with Fanny, tries to conceal the
child\'s existence -- but Bathsheba agrees that the coffin can be left
in her house overnight, from her sense of duty towards a former servant.
Her servant and confidante, Liddy, repeats the rumour that Fanny had a
child; when all the servants are in bed, Bathsheba unscrews the lid and
sees the two bodies inside. Troy then comes home from Casterbridge,
where he had gone to keep his appointment with Fanny. Seeing the reason
for her failure to meet him, he gently kisses the corpse and tells the
anguished Bathsheba, \"This woman is more to me, dead as she is, than
ever you were, or are, or can be\". The next day he spends all his money
on a marble tombstone with the inscription: \"Erected by Francis Troy in
beloved memory of Fanny Robin \...\" Then, loathing himself and unable
to bear Bathsheba\'s company, he leaves. After a long walk, he bathes in
the sea, leaving his clothes on the beach. A strong current carries him
away, but he is rescued by a rowing boat.

### Troy returns {#troy_returns}

A year later, with Troy presumed drowned, Boldwood renews his suit.
Burdened with guilt over the pain she has caused him, Bathsheba
reluctantly consents to marry him in six years, long enough to have Troy
declared dead. Troy tires of his hand-to-mouth existence as a travelling
actor and considers reclaiming his position and wife. He returns to
Weatherbury on Christmas Eve and goes to Boldwood\'s house, where a
party is under way. He orders Bathsheba to come with him; when she
shrinks back in shock and dismay, he seizes her arm, and she screams. At
this, Boldwood shoots Troy dead and tries unsuccessfully to turn the
double-barrelled gun on himself. Although Boldwood is convicted of
murder and sentenced to be hanged, his friends petition the Home
Secretary for mercy, claiming insanity. This is granted, and Boldwood\'s
sentence is commuted to \"confinement during Her Majesty\'s pleasure\".
Bathsheba buries her husband in the same grave as Fanny Robin and their
child.

### Gabriel triumphant {#gabriel_triumphant}

Throughout her tribulations, Bathsheba comes to rely increasingly on her
oldest and, as she admits to herself, only real friend, Gabriel. When he
gives notice that he is leaving her employ, she realises how important
he has become to her well-being. That night, she goes alone to visit him
in his cottage, to find out why he is deserting her. Pressed, he
reluctantly reveals that it is because people have been gossiping that
he wants to marry her. She exclaims that it is \"\... too absurd -- too
soon -- to think of, by far!\" He bitterly agrees that it is absurd, but
when she corrects him, saying that it is only \"too soon\", he is
emboldened to ask once again for her hand in marriage. She accepts, and
the two are quietly married.

## The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1824)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Memoirs_and_Confessions_of_a_Justified_Sinner>

Many of the events of the novel are narrated twice; first by the
\'editor\', who gives his account of the facts as he understands them to
be, and then in the words of the \'sinner\' himself. The story starts in
1687 with the marriage of Rabina Orde to the much older George Colwan,
Laird of Dalcastle. Rabina despises her new husband because he falls
short of her extreme religious beliefs, his love of dancing and penchant
for drinking alcohol. She initially flees him but her father forces her
back, and they live separately in the one house. Rabina gives birth to
two sons. The first, George, is indisputably the son of the Laird, but
it is strongly implied -- though never confirmed -- that her second son,
Robert, was fathered by the Reverend Wringhim, Rabina\'s spiritual
adviser and close confidant. George, raised by the Laird, becomes a
popular young man who enjoys sport and the company of his friends.
Robert, educated by his mother and adoptive father Wringhim, is brought
up to follow Wringhim\'s radical antinomian sect of Calvinism, which
holds that only certain elect people are predestined to be saved by God.
These chosen few will have a heavenly reward regardless of how their
lives are lived. The two brothers meet, as young men, in Edinburgh where
Robert starts following George through the town, mocking and provoking
him and disrupting his life. He appears to have the ability of appearing
wherever George is. When on a hill-top, George sees a vision of his
brother in the sky and turns to find him behind him, preparing to throw
him off a cliff. Robert rejects any friendly or placatory advances from
his brother. Finally, George is murdered by being stabbed in the back,
apparently during a duel with one of his drinking acquaintances. The
only witnesses to the murder were a prostitute and her despicable
client, who claim that the culprit was Robert, aided by what appears to
be the double of George\'s friend. Before Robert can be arrested, he
disappears. The second part of the novel consists of Robert\'s account
of his life. It purports to be a document, part-handwritten and
part-printed, which was found after his death. It recounts his
childhood, under the influence of the Rev Wringhim, and goes on to
explain how he becomes in thrall to an enigmatic companion who says his
name is Gil-Martin. This stranger, who could be seen to be the Devil,
appears after Wringhim has declared Robert to be a member of \'the
elect\' and so predestined to eternal salvation. Gil-Martin, who is able
to transform his appearance at will, soon directs all of Robert\'s
pre-existing tendencies and beliefs to evil purposes, convincing him
that it is his mission to \"cut sinners off with the sword\", and that
murder can be the correct course of action. From Gil-Martin\'s boasting
of the number of his adherents and size of his dominions, Robert falls
into the delusion that he is Peter the Great of Russia, who visited
England about that time. The confession traces Robert\'s gradual decline
into despair and madness, as his doubts about the righteousness of his
cause are counteracted by Gil-Martin\'s increasing domination over his
life. Finally, Robert loses control over his own identity and even loses
track of time. During these lost weeks and months, it is suggested that
Gil-Martin assumes Robert\'s appearance to commit further crimes.
However, there are also suggestions in the text, that \'Gil-Martin\' is
a figment of Robert\'s imagination, and is simply an aspect of his own
personality: as, for example when \'the sinner\' writes, \'I feel as if
I were the same person\' (as Gil-Martin). Robert flees, but is pursued
and tormented by devils and can find refuge only as a shepherd. Finally
he hangs himself with a grass rope -- in which it is suggested that he
is aided by devils. The novel concludes with a return to the \'Editor\'s
Narrative\' which explains how the sinner\'s memoir was discovered in
his grave. Hogg appears as himself in this section, expressing scorn of
the project to open the grave.

## A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man>

Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming
down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road
met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo \... His father told him that
story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne
lived: she sold lemon platt. The childhood of Stephen Dedalus is
recounted using vocabulary that changes as he grows, in a voice not his
own but sensitive to his feelings. The reader experiences Stephen\'s
fears and bewilderment as he comes to terms with the world in a series
of disjointed episodes. Stephen attends the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood
College, where the apprehensive, intellectually gifted boy suffers the
ridicule of his classmates while he learns the schoolboy codes of
behaviour. While he cannot grasp their significance, at a Christmas
dinner he is witness to the social, political and religious tensions in
Ireland involving Charles Stewart Parnell, which drive wedges between
members of his family, leaving Stephen with doubts over which social
institutions he can place his faith in. Back at Clongowes, word spreads
that a number of older boys have been caught \"smugging\"; discipline is
tightened, and the Jesuits increase use of corporal punishment. Stephen
is strapped when one of his instructors believes he has broken his
glasses to avoid studying, but, prodded by his classmates, Stephen works
up the courage to complain to the rector, Father Conmee, who assures him
there will be no such recurrence, leaving Stephen with a sense of
triumph.Stephen\'s father gets into debt and the family leaves its
pleasant suburban home to live in Dublin. Stephen realises that he will
not return to Clongowes. However, thanks to a scholarship obtained for
him by Father Conmee, Stephen is able to attend Belvedere College, where
he excels academically and becomes a class leader. Stephen squanders a
large cash prize from school, and begins to see prostitutes, as distance
grows between him and his drunken father.

As Stephen abandons himself to sensual pleasures, his class is taken on
a religious retreat, where the boys sit through sermons. Stephen pays
special attention to those on pride, guilt, punishment and the Four Last
Things (death, judgement, Hell, and Heaven). He feels that the words of
the sermon, describing horrific eternal punishment in hell, are directed
at himself and, overwhelmed, comes to desire forgiveness. Overjoyed at
his return to the Church, he devotes himself to acts of ascetic
repentance, though they soon devolve to mere acts of routine, as his
thoughts turn elsewhere. His devotion comes to the attention of the
Jesuits, and they encourage him to consider entering the priesthood.
Stephen takes time to consider, but has a crisis of faith because of the
conflict between his spiritual beliefs and his aesthetic ambitions.
Along Dollymount Strand he spots a girl wading, and has an epiphany in
which he is overcome with the desire to find a way to express her beauty
in his writing.As a student at University College, Dublin, Stephen grows
increasingly wary of the institutions around him: Church, school,
politics and family. In the midst of the disintegration of his family\'s
fortunes his father berates him and his mother urges him to return to
the Church. An increasingly dry, humourless Stephen explains his
alienation from the Church and the aesthetic theory he has developed to
his friends, who find that they cannot accept either of them. Stephen
concludes that Ireland is too restricted to allow him to express himself
fully as an artist, so he decides that he will have to leave. He sets
his mind on self-imposed exile, but not without declaring in his diary
his ties to his homeland: \... I go to encounter for the millionth time
the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the
uncreated conscience of my race.


## Ulysses (1922)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)>

### Part I: Telemachia {#part_i_telemachia}

#### Episode 1, Telemachus {#episode_1_telemachus}

It is 8 a.m. Buck Mulligan, a boisterous medical student, calls Stephen
Dedalus (a young writer encountered as the principal subject of A
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man) up to the roof of the Sandycove
Martello tower where they both live. There is tension between Stephen
and Mulligan, stemming from a cruel remark Stephen has overheard
Mulligan making about his recently deceased mother, May Dedalus, and
from the fact that Mulligan has invited an English student, Haines, to
stay with them. The three men eat breakfast and walk to the shore, where
Mulligan demands from Stephen the key to the tower and a loan.
Departing, Stephen declares that he will not return to the tower
tonight, as Mulligan, the \"usurper\", has taken it over.

#### Episode 2, Nestor {#episode_2_nestor}

Stephen is teaching a history class on the victories of Pyrrhus of
Epirus. After class, one student, Cyril Sargent, stays behind so that
Stephen can show him how to do a set of arithmetic exercises. Stephen
looks at the ugly face of Sargent and tries to imagine Sargent\'s
mother\'s love for him. Stephen then visits school headmaster Garrett
Deasy, from whom he collects his pay and a letter to take to a newspaper
office for printing. The two discuss Irish history and the role of Jews
in the economy. As Stephen leaves, Deasy said that Ireland has \"never
persecuted the Jews\" because the country \"never let them in\". This
episode is the source of some of the novel\'s most famous lines, such as
Dedalus\'s claim that \"history is a nightmare from which I am trying to
awake\" and that God is \"a shout in the street.\"

#### Episode 3, Proteus {#episode_3_proteus}

Stephen finds his way to Sandymount Strand and mopes around for some
time, mulling various philosophical concepts, his family, his life as a
student in Paris, and his mother\'s death. As Stephen reminisces and
ponders, he lies down among some rocks, watches a couple whose dog
urinates behind a rock, scribbles some ideas for poetry and picks his
nose. This chapter is characterised by a stream of consciousness
narrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen\'s education is
reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in
this episode, which have earned it a reputation for being one of the
book\'s most difficult chapters.

### Part II: Odyssey {#part_ii_odyssey}

#### Episode 4, Calypso {#episode_4_calypso}

The narrative shifts abruptly. The time is again 8 a.m., but the action
has moved across the city and to the second protagonist of the book,
Leopold Bloom, a part-Jewish advertising canvasser. The episode opens
with the famous line 'Mr. Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs
of beasts and fowls.' Bloom, after starting to prepare breakfast,
decides to walk to a butcher to buy a pork kidney. Returning home, he
prepares breakfast and brings it with the mail to his wife Molly as she
lounges in bed. One of the letters is from her concert manager Blazes
Boylan, with whom Molly is having an affair. Bloom is aware that Molly
will welcome Boylan into her bed later that day, and is tormented by the
thought. Bloom reads a letter from their daughter Milly Bloom, who tells
him about her progress in the photography business in Mullingar. The
episode closes with Bloom reading a magazine story titled Matcham's
Masterstroke, by Mr. Philip Beaufoy, while defecating in the outhouse.

#### Episode 5, Lotus Eaters {#episode_5_lotus_eaters}

Bloom makes his way to Westland Row post office, where he receives a
love letter from one \'Martha Clifford\' addressed to his pseudonym,
\'Henry Flower\'. He meets an acquaintance, and while they chat, Bloom
attempts to ogle a woman wearing stockings, but is prevented by a
passing tram. Next, he reads the letter and tears up the envelope in an
alley. He wanders into a Catholic church service and muses on theology.
The priest has the letters I.N.R.I. or I.H.S. on his back; Molly had
told Bloom that they meant I have sinned or I have suffered, and Iron
nails ran in. He goes to a chemist where he buys a bar of lemon soap. He
then meets another acquaintance, Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly takes him
to be offering a racing tip for the horse Throwaway. Finally, Bloom
heads towards the baths.

#### Episode 6, Hades {#episode_6_hades}

The episode begins with Bloom entering a funeral carriage with three
others, including Stephen\'s father. They drive to Paddy Dignam\'s
funeral, making small talk on the way. The carriage passes both Stephen
and Blazes Boylan. There is discussion of various forms of death and
burial, and Bloom is preoccupied by thoughts of his dead son, Rudy, and
the suicide of his own father. They enter the chapel into the service
and subsequently leave with the coffin cart. Bloom sees a mysterious man
wearing a mackintosh during the burial. Bloom continues to reflect upon
death, but at the end of the episode rejects morbid thoughts to embrace
\'warm fullblooded life\'.

#### Episode 7, Aeolus {#episode_7_aeolus}

At the office of the Freeman\'s Journal, Bloom attempts to place an ad.
Although initially encouraged by the editor, he is unsuccessful. Stephen
arrives bringing Deasy\'s letter about \'foot and mouth\' disease, but
Stephen and Bloom do not meet. Stephen leads the editor and others to a
pub, relating an anecdote on the way about \'two Dublin vestals\'. The
episode is broken into short segments by newspaper-style headlines, and
is characterised by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.

#### Episode 8, Lestrygonians {#episode_8_lestrygonians}

Bloom\'s thoughts are peppered with references to food as lunchtime
approaches. He meets an old flame, hears news of Mina Purefoy\'s labour,
and helps a blind boy cross the street. He enters the restaurant of the
Burton Hotel, where he is revolted by the sight of men eating like
animals. He goes instead to Davy Byrne\'s pub, where he consumes a
gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy, and muses upon the
early days of his relationship with Molly and how the marriage has
declined: \'Me. And me now.\' Bloom\'s thoughts touch on what goddesses
and gods eat and drink. He ponders whether the statues of Greek
goddesses in the National Museum have anuses as do mortals. On leaving
the pub Bloom heads toward the museum, but spots Boylan across the
street and, panicking, rushes into the gallery across the street from
the museum.

#### Episode 9, Scylla and Charybdis {#episode_9_scylla_and_charybdis}

At the National Library, Stephen explains to some scholars his
biographical theory of the works of Shakespeare, especially Hamlet,
which he claims are based largely on the posited adultery of
Shakespeare\'s wife. Bloom enters the National Library to look up an old
copy of the ad he has been trying to place. He encounters Stephen
briefly and unknowingly at the end of the episode.

#### Episode 10, Wandering Rocks {#episode_10_wandering_rocks}

In this episode, nineteen short vignettes depict the wanderings of
various characters, major and minor, through the streets of Dublin.
Included among these is a brief scene between Mulligan and Haines at a
coffeehouse patronized by the chess-playing brother of Irish hero
Charles Stewart Parnell, in which Haines and Mulligan discuss Stephen\'s
predicament. The scene is a type of ekphrasis in that Mulligan\'s
pronouncements, that the Catholic education system \"drove
\[Stephen\'s\] wits astray\" and that Stephen \"will never capture the
Attic note,\" point to a central tension in the novel between
contemplation and action, a tension best summarized elsewhere in Matthew
Arnold\'s essay Hebraism and Hellenism, which Joyce read and enjoyed.
The episode ends with an account of the cavalcade of the Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland, William Ward, Earl of Dudley, through the streets, which is
encountered by various characters from the novel.

#### Episode 11, Sirens {#episode_11_sirens}

In this episode, dominated by motifs of music, Bloom has dinner with
Stephen\'s uncle at a hotel, while Molly\'s lover, Blazes Boylan,
proceeds to his rendezvous with her. While dining, Bloom watches the
seductive barmaids and listens to the singing of Stephen\'s father and
others.

#### Episode 12, Cyclops {#episode_12_cyclops}

This chapter is narrated by an unnamed denizen of Dublin. The narrator
goes to Barney Kiernan\'s pub where he meets a character referred to
only as \"The Citizen\". There is a belief that this character is a
satirization of Michael Cusack, a founder member of the Gaelic Athletic
Association. When Leopold Bloom enters the pub, he is berated by the
Citizen, who is a fierce Fenian and anti-Semite. The episode ends with
Bloom reminding the Citizen that his Saviour was a Jew. As Bloom leaves
the pub, the Citizen, in anger, throws a biscuit tin at Bloom\'s head,
but misses. The chapter is marked by extended tangents made in voices
other than that of the unnamed narrator: these include streams of legal
jargon, Biblical passages, and elements of Irish mythology.

#### Episode 13, Nausicaa {#episode_13_nausicaa}

All the action of the episode takes place on the rocks of Sandymount
Strand, a shoreline area to the southeast of central Dublin. A young
woman named Gerty MacDowell is seated on the rocks with her two friends,
Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman. The girls are taking care of three
children, a baby, and four-year-old twins named Tommy and Jacky. Gerty
contemplates love, marriage and femininity as night falls. The reader is
gradually made aware that Bloom is watching her from a distance. Gerty
teases the onlooker by exposing her legs and underwear, and Bloom, in
turn, masturbates. Bloom\'s masturbatory climax is echoed by the
fireworks at the nearby bazaar. As Gerty leaves, Bloom realises that she
has a lame leg, and believes this is the reason she has been 'left on
the shelf'. After several mental digressions he decides to visit Mina
Purefoy at the maternity hospital. It is uncertain how much of the
episode is Gerty\'s thoughts, and how much is Bloom\'s sexual fantasy.
Some believe that the episode is divided into two halves: the first half
the highly romanticized viewpoint of Gerty, and the other half that of
the older and more realistic Bloom. Joyce himself said, however, that
'nothing happened between \[Gerty and Bloom\]. It all took place in
Bloom's imagination'. 'Nausicaa' attracted immense notoriety while the
book was being published in serial form. It has also attracted great
attention from scholars of disability in literature. The style of the
first half of the episode borrows from (and parodies) romance magazines
and novelettes.

#### Episode 14, Oxen of the Sun {#episode_14_oxen_of_the_sun}

Bloom visits the maternity hospital where Mina Purefoy is giving birth,
and finally meets Stephen, who has been drinking with his medical
student friends and is awaiting the promised arrival of Buck Mulligan.
As the only father in the group of men, Bloom is concerned about Mina
Purefoy in her labour. He starts thinking about his wife and the births
of his two children. He also thinks about the loss of his only 'heir',
Rudy. The young men become boisterous, and even start talking about
topics such as fertility, contraception and abortion. There is also a
suggestion that Milly, Bloom\'s daughter, is in a relationship with one
of the young men, Bannon. They continue on to a pub to continue
drinking, following the successful birth of a son to Mina Purefoy. This
chapter is remarkable for Joyce\'s wordplay, which, among other things,
recapitulates the entire history of the English language. After a short
incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, Anglo-Saxon
alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others, Malory,
the King James Bible, Bunyan, Pepys, Defoe, Sterne, Walpole, Gibbon,
Dickens, and Carlyle, before concluding in a haze of nearly
incomprehensible slang. The development of the English language in the
episode is believed to be aligned with the nine-month gestation period
of the foetus in the womb.

#### Episode 15, Circe {#episode_15_circe}

Episode 15 is written as a play script, complete with stage directions.
The plot is frequently interrupted by \"hallucinations\" experienced by
Stephen and Bloom---fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions
of the two characters. Stephen and Lynch walk into Nighttown, Dublin\'s
red-light district. Bloom pursues them and eventually finds them at
Bella Cohen\'s brothel where, in the company of her workers including
Zoe Higgins, Florry Talbot and Kitty Ricketts, he has a series of
hallucinations regarding his sexual fetishes, fantasies and
transgressions. Bloom is put in the dock to answer charges by a variety
of sadistic, accusing women including Mrs Yelverton Barry, Mrs
Bellingham and the Hon Mrs Mervyn Talboys. When Bloom witnesses Stephen
overpaying for services received, Bloom decides to hold onto the rest of
Stephen\'s money for safekeeping. Stephen hallucinates that the rotting
cadaver of his mother has risen up from the floor to confront him.
Terrified, Stephen uses his walking stick to smash a chandelier and then
runs out. Bloom quickly pays Bella for the damage, then runs after
Stephen. Bloom finds Stephen engaged in a heated argument with an
English soldier, Private Carr, who, after a perceived insult to the
King, punches Stephen. The police arrive and the crowd disperses. As
Bloom is tending to Stephen, Bloom has a hallucination of Rudy, his
deceased child.

### Part III: Nostos {#part_iii_nostos}

#### Episode 16, Eumaeus {#episode_16_eumaeus}

Bloom and Stephen go to the cabman\'s shelter to restore the latter to
his senses. At the cabman\'s shelter, they encounter a drunken sailor
named D. B. Murphy (W. B. Murphy in the 1922 text). The episode is
dominated by the motif of confusion and mistaken identity, with Bloom,
Stephen and Murphy\'s identities being repeatedly called into question.
The rambling and laboured style of the narrative in this episode
reflects the nervous exhaustion and confusion of the two protagonists.

#### Episode 17, Ithaca {#episode_17_ithaca}

Bloom returns home with Stephen, makes him a cup of cocoa, discusses
cultural and lingual differences between them, considers the possibility
of publishing Stephen\'s parable stories, and offers him a place to stay
for the night. Stephen refuses Bloom\'s offer and is ambiguous in
response to Bloom\'s proposal of future meetings. The two men urinate in
the backyard, Stephen departs and wanders off into the night, and Bloom
goes to bed, where Molly is sleeping. She awakens and questions him
about his day. The episode is written in the form of a rigidly organised
and \"mathematical\" catechism of 309 questions and answers, and was
reportedly Joyce\'s favourite episode in the novel. The deep
descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of
urination and include a famous list of 25 men perceived as Molly\'s
lovers (apparently corresponding to the suitors slain at Ithaca by
Odysseus and Telemachus in The Odyssey), including Boylan, and Bloom\'s
psychological reaction to their assignation. While describing events
apparently chosen randomly in ostensibly precise mathematical or
scientific terms, the episode is rife with errors made by the undefined
narrator, many or most of which are intentional by Joyce.

#### Episode 18, Penelope {#episode_18_penelope}

The final episode consists of Molly Bloom\'s thoughts as she lies in bed
next to her husband. The episode uses a stream-of-consciousness
technique in eight paragraphs and lacks punctuation. Molly thinks about
Boylan and Bloom, her past admirers, including Lieutenant Stanley G.
Gardner, the events of the day, her childhood in Gibraltar, and her
curtailed singing career. She also hints at a lesbian relationship, in
her youth, with a childhood friend named Hester Stanhope. These thoughts
are occasionally interrupted by distractions, such as a train whistle or
the need to urinate. The episode famously concludes with Molly\'s
remembrance of Bloom\'s marriage proposal, and of her acceptance: \"he
asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my
arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts
all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I
will Yes.\" The episode is also concerned with the occurrence of
Molly\'s early menstrual period. She considers the proximity of her
period following her extra-marital affairs with Boylan, and believes her
menstrual condition is the reason for her increased sexual appetite.
Molly corresponds to Penelope in Homer\'s epic poem, who is known for
her fidelity to Odysseus during his twenty-year absence, despite having
many suitors.

## The Call of the Wild (1903)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_the_Wild>

The story opens in 1897 with Buck, a powerful 140-pound St.
Bernard--Scotch Collie mix, happily living in California\'s Santa Clara
Valley as the pampered pet of Judge Miller and his family. When the
judge is out of town, assistant gardener Manuel, needing money to pay
off gambling debts, steals Buck and sells him to a stranger. Buck is
shipped to Seattle where, confined in a crate, is starved and
ill-treated. When released, Buck attacks his handler, the \"man in the
red sweater,\" who teaches Buck the \"law of the club,\" sufficiently
cowing him. The man shows some kindness after Buck stops attacking.
Shortly after, Buck is sold to two French-Canadian dispatchers from the
Canadian government, François and Perrault, who take him to Alaska. Buck
is trained as a sled dog for the Klondike region of Canada. Buck\'s
teammates teach him how to survive cold winter nights and about pack
society. A rivalry develops between Buck and the lead dog, Spitz, a
vicious and quarrelsome white husky. Buck eventually kills Spitz in a
fight and becomes the lead dog. When François and Perrault complete the
round-trip of the Yukon Trail in record time---returning to Skagway with
their dispatches, they are given new orders from the Canadian
government. They sell their sled team to a \"Scotch half-breed\" man,
who works in the mail service. The dogs must make long, tiring trips,
carrying heavy loads to the mining areas. While running the trail, Buck
seems to have memories of a canine ancestor who has a short-legged
\"hairy man\" companion. Meanwhile, the weary animals become weak, and
the wheel dog, Dave, a morose husky, becomes terminally sick and is
eventually shot. With too few dogs to continue, the mail-carrier sells
the remaining three, including Buck, to three stampeders from the
American Southland (present-day contiguous United States)---a vain woman
named Mercedes, her sheepish husband, Charles, and her arrogant brother,
Hal. They lack survival skills for the Northern wilderness and struggle
to control the sled. The trio ignore others\' helpful
advice---particularly warnings about the dangerous spring melt. When
told her sled is too heavy, Mercedes dumps out crucial supplies in favor
of fashion objects. They foolishly create a team of 14 dogs, believing
they will travel faster. The dogs are overfed and over-worked, then are
starved when food runs low. Most dogs die, leaving only five when they
pull into White River. They meet John Thornton, an experienced
outdoorsman, who notices the dogs\' poor, weakened condition. The trio
ignores Thornton\'s warnings about crossing the ice and press onward.
Exhausted, starving, and sensing danger ahead, Buck refuses to continue.
After Hal beats Buck, Thornton, disgusted by the Hal\'s treatment, hits
him and cuts Buck free. The trio leaves and cross the river with the
four remaining dogs. The ice breaks and the dogs and humans (along with
their sled) fall into the river and drown. As Thornton nurses Buck back
to health, Buck grows to love him. Buck saves Thornton when he falls
into a river. After Thornton takes him on trips to pan for gold, a
bonanza king (someone who struck it rich in the gold fields), named Mr.
Matthewson, wagers Thornton on Buck\'s strength and devotion. Buck pulls
a sled with a half-ton (1,000-pound (450 kg)) load of flour, breaking it
free from the frozen ground, dragging it 100 yards (91 m) and winning
Thornton US\$1,600 in gold dust. A \"king of the Skookum Benches\"
offers a large sum to buy Buck, but Thornton declines. Using his
winnings, Thornton retires his debts but elects to continue searching
for gold with friends Pete and Hans---sledding Buck and six other dogs
to search for a fabled Lost Cabin. Once they locate a suitable gold
find, the dogs have nothing to do. Buck has more ancestor-memories of
being with the primitive \"hairy man.\" While Thornton and his two
friends pan gold, Buck hears the call of the wild, explores the
wilderness, and socializes with a Northwestern wolf from a local pack.
However, Buck does not join the wolves and returns to Thornton. Buck
repeatedly goes back and forth between Thornton and the wild. Returning
to the campsite one day, he finds Hans, Pete, and Thornton have been
murdered by Native-American Yeehats. Enraged, Buck kills several natives
to avenge Thornton, then realizes he no longer has any human ties. He
goes looking for his wild brother and encounters a hostile wolf pack. He
fights them and wins, then discovers that the lone wolf he had
socialized with is a pack member. Buck follows the pack into the forest
and answers the call of the wild. The legend of Buck spreads among other
Native Americans as the \"Ghost Dog\" of the Northland (Alaska and
northwestern Canada). Each year, on the anniversary of his attack on the
Yeehats, Buck returns to the former campsite where he was last with
Thornton, Hans, and Pete, to mourn their deaths. Every winter, leading
the wolf-pack, Buck wreaks vengeance on the Yeehats, \"as he sings a
song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.\"


# Vladimir Nabokov

## Pale Fire (1962)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Fire>

Shade\'s poem digressively describes many aspects of his life. Canto 1
includes his early encounters with death and glimpses of what he takes
to be the supernatural. Canto 2 is about his family and the apparent
suicide of his daughter, Hazel Shade. Canto 3 focuses on Shade\'s search
for knowledge about an afterlife, culminating in a \"faint hope\" in
higher powers \"playing a game of worlds\" as indicated by apparent
coincidences. Canto 4 offers details on Shade\'s daily life and creative
process, as well as thoughts on his poetry, which he finds to be a means
of somehow understanding the universe. In Kinbote\'s editorial
contributions he tells three stories intermixed with each other. One is
his own story, notably including what he thinks of as his friendship
with Shade. After Shade was murdered, Kinbote acquired the manuscript,
including some variants, and has taken it upon himself to oversee the
poem\'s publication, telling readers that it lacks only line 1000.
Kinbote\'s second story deals with King Charles II, \"The Beloved\", the
deposed king of Zembla. King Charles escaped imprisonment by
Soviet-backed revolutionaries, making use of a secret passage and brave
adherents in disguise. Kinbote repeatedly claims that he inspired Shade
to write the poem by recounting King Charles\'s escape to him and that
possible allusions to the king, and to Zembla, appear in Shade\'s poem,
especially in rejected drafts. However, no explicit reference to King
Charles is to be found in the poem. Kinbote\'s third story is that of
Gradus, an assassin dispatched by the new rulers of Zembla to kill the
exiled King Charles. Gradus makes his way from Zembla through Europe and
America to New Wye, suffering comic mishaps. In the last note, to the
missing line 1000, Kinbote narrates how Gradus killed Shade by mistake.
Towards the end of the narrative, Kinbote all but states that he is in
fact the exiled King Charles, living incognito; however, enough details
throughout the story, as well as direct statements of ambiguous
sincerity by Kinbote towards the novel\'s end, suggest that King Charles
and Zembla are both fictitious. In the latter interpretation, Kinbote is
delusional and has built an elaborate picture of Zembla complete with
samples of a constructed language as a by-product of insanity;
similarly, Gradus was simply an unhinged man trying to kill Shade, and
his backstory as a revolutionary assassin is also made up. In an
interview, Nabokov later claimed that Kinbote committed suicide after
finishing the book. The critic Michael Wood has stated, \"This is
authorial trespassing, and we don\'t have to pay attention to it\", but
Brian Boyd has argued that internal evidence points to Kinbote\'s
suicide. One of Kinbote\'s annotations to Shade\'s poem (corresponding
to line 493) addresses the subject of suicide at some length.

## Fight Club (1996)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_(novel)>

Fight Club centers on an anonymous narrator, who works as a product
recall specialist for an unnamed car company. Because of the stress of
his job and the jet lag brought upon by frequent business trips, he
begins to suffer from recurring insomnia. When he seeks treatment, his
doctor advises him to visit a support group for testicular cancer
victims to \"see what real suffering is like\". He finds that sharing
the problems of others---despite not having testicular cancer
himself---alleviates his insomnia. The narrator\'s unique treatment
works until he meets Marla Singer, another \"tourist\" who visits the
support group under false pretenses. The possibly disturbed Marla
reminds the narrator that he is a faker who does not belong there. He
begins to hate Marla for keeping him from crying, and, therefore, from
sleeping. After a confrontation, the two agree to attend separate
support group meetings to avoid each other. The truce is uneasy, and the
narrator\'s insomnia returns. While on a nude beach, the narrator meets
Tyler Durden, a charismatic extremist of mysterious means. After an
explosion destroys the narrator\'s condominium, he asks to stay at
Tyler\'s house. Tyler agrees, but asks for something in return: \"I want
you to hit me as hard as you can.\" Both men find that they enjoy the
ensuing fistfight. They subsequently move in together and establish a
\"fight club\", drawing numerous men with similar temperaments into
bare-knuckle fighting matches, set to the following rules:

You don\'t talk about fight club. You don\'t talk about fight club. When
someone says stop, or goes limp, the fight is over. Only two guys to a
fight. One fight at a time. They fight without shirts or shoes. The
fights go on as long as they have to. If this is your first night at
fight club, you have to fight. Later in the book, a mechanic tells the
narrator about two new rules of the fight club: nobody is the center of
the fight club except for the two men fighting, and the fight club will
always be free. Marla, noticing that the narrator has not recently
attended his support groups, calls him to claim that she has overdosed
on Xanax in a half-hearted suicide attempt. Tyler returns from work,
picks up the phone to Marla\'s drug-induced rambling, and rescues her.
Tyler and Marla embark on an uneasy affair that confounds the narrator
and confuses Marla. Throughout this affair, Marla is unaware both of
fight club\'s existence and the interaction between Tyler and the
narrator. Because Tyler and Marla are never seen at the same time, the
narrator wonders whether Tyler and Marla are the same person. As fight
club attains a nationwide presence, Tyler uses it to spread his
anti-consumerist ideas, recruiting fight club\'s members to participate
in increasingly elaborate pranks on corporate America. He eventually
gathers the most devoted fight club members and forms \"Project
Mayhem\", a cult-like organization that trains itself as an army to
bring down modern civilization. This organization, like fight club, is
controlled by a set of rules:

You don\'t ask questions. You don\'t ask questions. No excuses. No lies.
You have to trust Tyler. While initially a loyal participant in Project
Mayhem, the narrator becomes uncomfortable with the increasing
destructiveness of its activities. He resolves to stop Tyler and his
followers when Bob, a friend from the testicular cancer support group,
is killed during one of Project Mayhem\'s sabotage operations. The
narrator then learns that he himself is Tyler Durden. As the narrator\'s
mental state deteriorated, his mind formed a new personality that was
able to escape from the problems of his life. Marla inadvertently
reveals to the narrator that he and Tyler are the same person. Tyler\'s
affair with Marla---whom the narrator professes to dislike---was the
narrator\'s own affair with Marla. The narrator\'s bouts of insomnia had
been Tyler\'s personality surfacing; Tyler was active whenever the
narrator was \"sleeping\". The Tyler personality not only created fight
club, he also blew up the Narrator\'s condo. Tyler plans to blow up a
skyscraper using homemade bombs created by Project Mayhem; the target of
the explosion is the nearby national museum. Tyler plans to die as a
martyr during this event, taking the narrator\'s life as well. Realizing
this, the narrator sets out to stop Tyler, although Tyler is always
thinking ahead of him. The narrator makes his way to the roof of the
building, where Tyler holds him at gunpoint. When Marla comes to the
roof with one of the support groups, Tyler vanishes, as Tyler \"was his
hallucination, not hers.\"With Tyler gone, the narrator waits for the
bomb to explode and kill him. The bomb malfunctions because Tyler mixed
paraffin into the explosives. Still alive and holding Tyler\'s gun, the
narrator makes the first decision that is truly his own: he puts the gun
in his mouth and shoots himself. Some time later, he awakens in a mental
hospital, believing he is in Heaven, and imagines an argument with God
over human nature. The book ends with the narrator being approached by
hospital employees who reveal themselves to be Project members. They
tell him their plans still continue, and that they are expecting Tyler
to come back.

## Midnight's Children (1981)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight's_Children>

Midnight\'s Children is a loose allegory for events in India both before
and, primarily, after the independence and partition of India. The
protagonist and narrator of the story is Saleem Sinai, born at the exact
moment when India became an independent country. He was born with
telepathic powers, as well as an enormous and constantly dripping nose
with an extremely sensitive sense of smell. The novel is divided into
three books. The book begins with the story of the Sinai family,
particularly with events leading up to India\'s Independence and
Partition. Saleem is born precisely at midnight, 15 August 1947,
therefore, exactly as old as independent India. He later discovers that
all children born in India between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. on that date are
imbued with special powers. Saleem, using his telepathic powers,
assembles a Midnight Children\'s Conference, reflective of the issues
India faced in its early statehood concerning the cultural, linguistic,
religious, and political differences faced by a vastly diverse nation.
Saleem acts as a telepathic conduit, bringing hundreds of geographically
disparate children into contact while also attempting to discover the
meaning of their gifts. In particular, those children born closest to
the stroke of midnight wield more powerful gifts than the others. Shiva
\"of the Knees\", Saleem\'s nemesis, and Parvati, called
\"Parvati-the-witch,\" are two of these children with notable gifts and
roles in Saleem\'s story. Meanwhile, Saleem\'s family begin a number of
migrations and endure the numerous wars which plague the subcontinent.
During this period he also suffers amnesia until he enters a
quasi-mythological exile in the jungle of Sundarban, where he is
re-endowed with his memory. In doing so, he reconnects with his
childhood friends. Saleem later becomes involved with the Indira
Gandhi-proclaimed Emergency and her son Sanjay\'s \"cleansing\" of the
Jama Masjid slum. For a time Saleem is held as a political prisoner;
these passages contain scathing criticisms of Indira Gandhi\'s
over-reach during the Emergency as well as a personal lust for power
bordering on godhood. The Emergency signals the end of the potency of
the Midnight Children, and there is little left for Saleem to do but
pick up the few pieces of his life he may still find and write the
chronicle that encompasses both his personal history and that of his
still-young nation, a chronicle written for his son, who, like his
father, is both chained and supernaturally endowed by history.


# Sir Walter Scott

## Rob Roy (1817)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Roy_(novel)>

Francis \"Frank\" Osbaldistone tells his tale, beginning with his return
to his father William\'s merchant house of Osbaldistone and Tresham in
Crane Alley, London, from an apprenticeship in a French associate\'s
business. There, he meets with his business-minded father\'s anger and
disappointment, since he has been more preoccupied with writing poetry
than learning the business, much to his father\'s disgust. William was
originally disinherited in favour of his younger brother Sir Hildebrand
Osbaldistone, who has inherited both the family fortune and the family
seat of Osbaldistone Hall instead. William, turned out at the age of his
own son, has built a successful business with his trading company in the
City and is a dissenter in religion, unlike his brother. Owen, the Head
Clerk of Osbaldistone and Tresham and a long time friend of the family,
attempts to persuade Frank to follow his father\'s wishes. Frank is not
swayed. Instead, William sends him to stay with his uncle Hildebrand in
Northumberland, near the border with Scotland. Frank sets out on
horseback, meeting some travellers on the way. He observes that one of
the travellers is nervous and protective of a box that he carries. Frank
begins to tease the traveller, Morris, pretending to assume an interest
in the mysterious box. At an inn, they are joined by a confident and
sociable Scottish \"cattle dealer" Campbell. They eat and drink and
discuss politics together at an inn and then part ways, when Morris
entreats Campbell to travel with him to provide protection, since
Campbell has recounted how he thwarted two highwaymen singlehandedly.
After Frank parts from the company near his destination, he encounters a
fox hunt in progress. A lovely young huntress, dressed in riding habit,
greets him and guesses his identity. Frank is smitten by the young
woman, noting her intelligence and beauty along with her independent
manner. She is Diana \"Die\" Vernon, a relative by marriage of Sir
Hildebrand. They proceed to Osbaldistone Hall, a large, rambling and
run-down old manor-house, filled with massive old furniture, rusted
suits of armour, hunting trophies, marking the interests of his uncle
and cousins. Frank meets old Sir Hildebrand, a former Cavalier, and his
five older sons, each described by Die as given entirely to drinking and
sport. At dinner, he meets the youngest brother, Rashleigh, who, unlike
his father and brothers, is sober, charming and erudite. Frank notes a
connection between Die and Rashleigh. Die explains that Rashleigh, a
scholar intended for the priesthood, is her tutor. The next day, after
encountering Andrew Fairservice the gardener, a loquacious Scotsman,
Diana tells Frank that he has been charged with robbery and that the
local Justice of the Peace Squire Inglewood, has a warrant for his
arrest. Rather than flee to Scotland, he determines to protest his
innocence. Die guides him and they encounter Rashleigh, who claims to
have been pleading Frank\'s case. After declaring his innocence to the
Justice, Frank confronts his accuser, who is none other than Morris.
Morris, a government paymaster, has been robbed of his mysterious box,
which contained gold specie with which to pay the English troops in the
area. Frank\'s prior light-hearted interest in Morris\' box on the
journey north is the basis for the charge. Upon Frank\'s vehement
declaration of innocence, and the Justice\'s sympathetic acquittal,
Morris abandons his suit against Frank. Jobson, the Squire\'s pedantic
and officious clerk, wants to pursue the matter on legal principle.
After diverting Jobson by sending him on wild-goose chase, Rashleigh
departs and quickly returns with the cattle-dealer, Campbell. Campbell
witnesses truthfully that he was at the scene of the robbery and did not
see Frank. Freed by the Squire from the charge, Frank returns to
Osbaldistone Hall. He is consumed with jealousy after discovering that
Rashleigh was in serious consideration for Die\'s hand in marriage; the
usually sober Frank gets drunk with the family after Die exits, and
strikes Rashleigh during an argument. In the morning, Frank apologises
sincerely but Rashleigh\'s too-quick forgiveness rings false. Rashleigh
travels to take Frank\'s place at Osbaldistone and Tresham. Diana warns
Frank that Rashleigh is a subtle and dangerous conniver, and has her
under his power. Frank begins to tutor Die and falls even more deeply in
love with her. In between hours in the library with Die or in hunting
with his cousins, he converses with Andrew Fairservice and learns much
about goings on at the Hall: there are suspicious visitations by shadowy
persons unknown; the servants fear a ghost that haunts the library; and
a mysterious Catholic priest, Father Vaughan, visits the hall. Frank
receives a letter from Tresham asking him to meet Owen in Glasgow and,
only then, realises that none of his letters have reached London,
including one warning his father of Rashleigh\'s dubious character. Die
informs him that while William has been on the continent, Rashleigh has
absconded with financial instruments vital to Osbaldistone and
Tresham\'s solvency. Frank determines to help his father\'s business. He
parts with Diana. She is destined to live in a convent due to a family
compact (in which she has no say), as she refuses to marry any of Sir
Hildebrand\'s sons. He enlists Andrew Fairservice as his servant and
guide and hurries to Glasgow to find Owen and catch Rashleigh, who is
now understood to be a Jacobite agent and agitator.

They lodge in Glasgow, and at services in a famous kirk in the religious
town, an unseen stranger presses a note into Frank\'s hand telling him
he is in danger and to meet him on a well-known bridge at midnight for
information. Frank meets the stranger, who conveys him to the tolbooth
(jail), which they enter unchallenged. Inside they find Owen, who is
overjoyed to see Frank. Osbaldistone and Tresham\'s favoured Scottish
trading partner, MacVitie, maliciously made Owen a debtor on behalf of
his now insolvent employer and imprisoned him. Bailie Nicol Jarvie, a
Glasgow magistrate who is also a Scottish partner of Osbaldistone and
Tresham, arrives at the jail after midnight, when Sabbath is over. The
mysterious stranger is Campbell, whom Jarvie recognises as his kinsman,
Rob Roy McGregor. On Rob\'s promise to repay Jarvie 1000 Scots pounds
that he owes him, Jarvie never says his name. Jarvie frees Owen, and
allows Frank and Campbell to leave. The absent turnkey (jailer), who has
let them pass in and out freely, is Rob Roy\'s man, Dougal. Before
disappearing with Dougal, Rob tells Frank to meet him in his Highland
home and suggests that Bailie Jarvie should accompany him to collect his
gold. While Jarvie and Owen discuss finances, Frank takes a walk to the
University grounds, where he spies Rashleigh walking with Morris and
MacVitie. Frank confronts Rashleigh and they duel. Rob Roy breaks it up.
After Rob sends Rashleigh away, he tells Frank to meet him at the
Clachan of Aberfoyle in the Highlands. Frank now realises that Rob\'s
affairs are entwined with his own and that Rob has had a long
association with Rashleigh and Die. Frank, Jarvie and Andrew ride to the
Clachan, where they find a rude country inn. Tired, cold and hungry,
they enter over the objections of the landlady and the three men in
plaids, drinking brandy at a table. A brief brawl ensues between the two
parties, which is broken up by a fourth Highlander who has been sleeping
on the floor. This man disappears, as Frank recognises him as Dougal,
Rob\'s man. Frank and Jarvie converse with the men in plaid, and find
they are the leaders of bands of armed men. Two are Highlanders; the
second is a Lowland chief, Duncan Galbraith, who heads the Lennox
militia. All have been enlisted by the English army to find and arrest
Rob Roy. Thus Rob Roy does not meet them at the inn, but sends a note to
Frank to meet at his home. Suddenly, an English patrol enters the inn,
dragging Dougal with them. Frank and Jarvie are arrested as they fit the
descriptions of the two people whom the patrol seeks. The soldiers force
Dougal to lead them to Rob\'s lair, bringing Frank, Jarvie and Andrew
along. They are ambushed by Highlanders, and the patrol is disarmed.
Dougal, playing the fool, has led the patrol into a trap. The leader of
the Highlanders is Helen, Rob\'s wife, a fierce, proud noblewoman, fully
armed. Her band is composed mostly of old men, women and children. After
declaiming the wrongs done to her and her clan, she produces the
unfortunate Morris, now a hostage, and he is callously thrown into the
nearby loch. The fighting men of the band, armed for battle, and led by
Rob\'s two sons arrive. They report that Rob has been captured by the
Duke\'s army. After Jarvie successfully appeals for clemency for them
from Helen, pleading kinship, Frank is sent as emissary to the Duke\'s
camp. He finds Rob is tied up for execution. The Duke\'s army sets off,
but Rob escapes in crossing the river. Frank lays low in the confusion
that ensues. Then he walks in the dark night along a path through the
forest back to the Clachan. He meets Diana and a stranger, an older
nobleman, riding on the path. Die gives him the missing bills that
Rashleigh had taken and bids him adieu. Frank sadly assumes that the man
is Diana\'s husband. Frank is overtaken by Rob, who takes him to his
home, after expressing anger at Morris\' murder. There, Jarvie and
Andrew are already ensconced. Jarvie reviews the recovered bills and
declares Osbaldistone and Tresham to be cleared of debt. Rob repays
Jarvie with 1000 pounds of gold louis d\'or. During the night, Rob tells
Frank of how he and Rashleigh robbed Morris -- a lark for Rob as an
accomplished cattle-thief and blackmailer, but serious business for
Rashleigh as a Jacobite agent. By now, Rashleigh has become a turncoat
to save his skin and flees to Stirling as a traitor to the Jacobite
cause. Frank and Jarvie are sent on their way homeward to Glasgow, after
an emotional farewell from Rob, Helen, and their clansmen. In Glasgow
Frank is greeted with warmth and forgiveness by his father, who has
prospered while on the continent. In gratitude for his assistance and
even-handedness, William rewards Bailie Jarvie with the commercial
accounts that he has stripped from MacVitie. While finishing up their
business in Glasgow, a rebellion of Jacobites breaks out. Frank, his
father, and Owen, escape to London, where Frank levies a company of
soldiers and rides north to support King George\'s cause. The rebellion
is quickly suppressed, and back in London, Frank learns of the downfall
of Sir Hildebrand (who has been captured and imprisoned in Newgate) and
deaths of Sir Hildebrand\'s five older sons through misfortune or
battle. Frank is heir to Osbaldistone Hall by his uncle\'s last will.
Rashleigh, the surviving son, has been disinherited in favour of Frank
as punishment by his father. Frank travels to claim the property. He
meets with Justice Inglewood to review his uncle\'s will and learns from
him that Diana and her father are thought to be out of England now; she
is single and her father was deeply involved with the Rebellion, and he
had visited Die in the role of Father Vaughan. This was the secret that
Rashleigh held over her. With Andrew Fairservice, Frank takes possession
of Osbaldistone Hall. Nostalgically selecting the library to sleep in,
he finds Diana and her father hiding there. They request sanctuary as
they are being hunted due to the failure of the Jacobite uprising. They
tell Frank how Sir Frederick had been hidden at the Hall during his
earlier stay. They plan to leave, but Rashleigh arrives with Jobson and
the local constables, bringing a warrant to take possession of the Hall
and arrest the Vernons and Frank. They are easily captured and taken
away in a carriage. Still on the property, Rob Roy springs an ambush,
freeing them all and killing Rashleigh. Rob Roy and his men bring Diana
and her father to safety in France. Not many months later, after Frank
begins working with his father, they learn that Diana\'s father is dying
in France, and allows his daughter to make her own choice of the convent
or marriage. Frank tells his father of his love for Diana. He gains his
father\'s approval to marry a Catholic, as startling to him as his son
owning Osbaldistone Hall.


## Ivanhoe (1820)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe>

### Opening

Protagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of
Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in
love with the Lady Rowena, a ward of Cedric and descendant of the Saxon
Kings of England. Cedric planned to have Rowena marry the powerful Lord
Athelstane, a pretender to the Crown of England by his descent from the
last Saxon King, Harold Godwinson. Ivanhoe accompanies King Richard on
the Crusades, where he is said to have played a notable role in the
Siege of Acre; and tends to Louis of Thuringia, who suffers from
malaria. The book opens with a scene of Norman knights and prelates
seeking the hospitality of Cedric. They are guided there by a pilgrim,
known at that time as a palmer. Also returning from the Holy Land that
same night, Isaac of York, a Jewish moneylender, seeks refuge at
Rotherwood. Following the night\'s meal, the palmer observes one of the
Normans, the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, issue orders to his Saracen
soldiers to capture Isaac. The palmer then assists in Isaac\'s escape
from Rotherwood, with the additional aid of the swineherd Gurth. Isaac
of York offers to repay his debt to the palmer with a suit of armour and
a war horse to participate in the tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouch
Castle, on his inference that the palmer was secretly a knight. The
palmer is taken by surprise, but accepts the offer.

### The tournament {#the_tournament}

The tournament is presided over by Prince John. Also in attendance are
Cedric, Athelstane, Lady Rowena, Isaac of York, his daughter Rebecca,
Robin of Locksley and his men, Prince John\'s advisor Waldemar Fitzurse,
and numerous Norman knights. On the first day of the tournament, in a
bout of individual jousting, a mysterious knight, identifying himself
only as \"Desdichado\" (described in the book as Spanish, taken by the
Saxons to mean Disinherited), defeats Bois-Guilbert. The masked knight
declines to reveal himself despite Prince John\'s request, but is
nevertheless declared the champion of the day and is permitted to choose
the Queen of the Tournament. He bestows this honour upon Lady Rowena. On
the second day, at a melee, Desdichado is the leader of one party,
opposed by his former adversaries. Desdichado\'s side is soon hard
pressed and he himself beset by multiple foes until rescued by a knight
nicknamed \'Le Noir Faineant\' (\"the Black Sluggard\"), who thereafter
departs in secret. When forced to unmask himself to receive his coronet
(the sign of championship), Desdichado is identified as Wilfred of
Ivanhoe, returned from the Crusades. This causes much consternation to
Prince John and his court who now fear the imminent return of King
Richard. Ivanhoe is severely wounded in the competition yet his father
does not move quickly to tend to him. Instead, Rebecca, a skilled
healer, tends to him while they are lodged near the tournament and then
convinces her father to take Ivanhoe with them to their home in York,
when he is fit for that trip. The conclusion of the tournament includes
feats of archery by Locksley, such as splitting a willow reed with his
arrow. Prince John's dinner for the local Saxons ends in insults.

### Capture and rescue {#capture_and_rescue}

In the forests between Ashby and York, Isaac, Rebecca and the wounded
Ivanhoe are abandoned by their guards, who fear bandits and take all of
Isaac's horses. Cedric, Athelstane and the Lady Rowena meet them and
agree to travel together. The party is captured by de Bracy and his
companions and taken to Torquilstone, the castle of Front-de-Boeuf. The
swineherd Gurth and Wamba the jester manage to escape, and then
encounter Locksley, who plans a rescue.

The Black Knight, having taken refuge for the night in the hut of local
friar, the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, volunteers his assistance on
learning about the captives from Robin of Locksley. They then besiege
the Castle of Torquilstone with Robin\'s own men, including the friar
and assorted Saxon yeomen. Inside Torquilstone, de Bracy expresses his
love for the Lady Rowena but is refused. Brian de Bois-Guilbert tries to
seduce Rebecca and is rebuffed. Front-de-Boeuf tries to wring a hefty
ransom from Isaac of York, but Isaac refuses to pay unless his daughter
is freed. When the besiegers deliver a note to yield up the captives,
their Norman captors demand a priest to administer the Final Sacrament
to Cedric; whereupon Cedric\'s jester Wamba slips in disguised as a
priest, and takes the place of Cedric, who escapes and brings important
information to the besiegers on the strength of the garrison and its
layout. The besiegers storm the castle. The castle is set aflame during
the assault by Ulrica, the daughter of the original lord of the castle,
Lord Torquilstone, as revenge for her father\'s death. Front-de-Boeuf is
killed in the fire while de Bracy surrenders to the Black Knight, who
identifies himself as King Richard and releases de Bracy. Bois-Guilbert
escapes with Rebecca while Isaac is rescued by the Clerk of Copmanhurst.
The Lady Rowena is saved by Cedric, while the still-wounded Ivanhoe is
rescued from the burning castle by King Richard. In the fighting,
Athelstane is wounded and presumed dead while attempting to rescue
Rebecca, whom he mistakes for Rowena.

### Rebecca\'s trial and Ivanhoe\'s reconciliation {#rebeccas_trial_and_ivanhoes_reconciliation}

Following the battle, Locksley plays host to King Richard. Word is
conveyed by de Bracy to Prince John of the King\'s return and the fall
of Torquilstone. In the meantime, Bois-Guilbert rushes with his captive
to the nearest Templar Preceptory, where Lucas de Beaumanoir, the Grand
Master of the Templars, takes umbrage at Bois-Guilbert\'s infatuation
and subjects Rebecca to a trial for witchcraft. At Bois-Guilbert\'s
secret request, she claims the right to trial by combat; and
Bois-Guilbert, who had hoped for the position, is devastated when the
Grand-Master orders him to fight against Rebecca\'s champion. Rebecca
then writes to her father to procure a champion for her. Cedric
organises Athelstane\'s funeral at Coningsburgh, in the midst of which
the Black Knight arrives with a companion. Cedric, who had not been
present at Locksley\'s carousal, is ill-disposed towards the knight upon
learning his true identity; but Richard calms Cedric and reconciles him
with his son. During this conversation, Athelstane emerges -- not dead,
but laid in his coffin alive by monks desirous of the funeral money.
Over Cedric\'s renewed protests, Athelstane pledges his homage to the
Norman King Richard and urges Cedric to marry Rowena to Ivanhoe; to
which Cedric finally agrees. Soon after this reconciliation, Ivanhoe
receives word from Isaac beseeching him to fight on Rebecca\'s behalf.
Ivanhoe, riding day and night, arrives in time for the trial by combat,
but horse and man are exhausted, with little chance of victory. The two
knights make one charge at each other with lances, Bois-Guilbert
appearing to have the advantage. However, Bois-Guilbert, a man trying to
have it all without offering to marry Rebecca, dies of natural causes in
the saddle before the combat can continue. Fearing further persecution,
Rebecca and her father plan to leave England for Granada. Before
leaving, Rebecca comes to bid Rowena a fond farewell on her wedding day.
Ivanhoe and Rowena marry and live a long and happy life together.
Ivanhoe\'s military service ends with the death of King Richard.

## The Grapes of Wrath (1939)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath>

The narrative begins just after Tom Joad is paroled from McAlester
prison, where he had been incarcerated after being convicted of
homicide. While hitchhiking to his home near Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Tom
meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he remembers from his childhood,
and the two travel together. When they arrive at Tom\'s childhood farm
home, they find it deserted. Disconcerted and confused, Tom and Casy
meet their old neighbor, Muley Graves, who tells them the family has
gone to stay at Uncle John Joad\'s home nearby. Graves tells them that
the banks have evicted all the farmers, but he refuses to leave the
area. The next morning, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John\'s. Tom finds his
family loading their remaining possessions into a Hudson sedan converted
into a truck; with their crops destroyed by the Dust Bowl, the family
has defaulted on their bank loans, and their farm has been repossessed.
The family sees no option but to seek work in California, which has been
described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay. The Joads put
everything they have into making the journey. Although leaving Oklahoma
would violate his parole, Tom decides it is worth the risk, and invites
Casy to join him and his family. Traveling west on Route 66, the Joad
family finds the road crowded with other migrants. In makeshift camps,
they hear many stories from others, some returning from California, and
the group worries that California may not actually be as promising as it
seems. The family dwindles as well: Grandpa dies along the road, and
they bury him in a field; Grandma dies close to the California state
line; and both Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie Rivers (the husband
of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon) leave the family. Led by
Ma, the remaining members realize they can only continue, as nothing is
left for them in Oklahoma. Reaching California, they find the state
oversupplied with labor; wages are low, and workers are exploited to the
point of starvation. The big corporate farmers are in collusion and
smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices. Weedpatch Camp, one of
the clean, utility-supplied camps operated by the Resettlement
Administration, a New Deal agency, offers better conditions but does not
have enough resources to care for all the needy families. Nonetheless,
as a Federal facility, the camp protects the migrants from harassment by
local deputies.

In response to the exploitation, Casy becomes a labor organizer and
tries to recruit for a labor union. The remaining Joads find work as
strikebreakers in a peach orchard, where Casy is involved in a strike
that eventually turns violent. When Tom witnesses Casy\'s fatal beating,
he kills the attacker and flees as a fugitive. The Joads quietly leave
the orchard to work at a cotton farm, where Tom remains at risk of being
arrested for the homicide. Knowing he must leave the area or risk being
caught and his family blacklisted from working, Tom bids his mother
farewell and vows to work for the oppressed. The rest of the family
continues to pick cotton and pool their daily wages so they can buy
food. Rose of Sharon\'s baby is stillborn. Ma Joad remains steadfast and
forces the family through the bereavement. With the winter rains, the
Joads\' dwelling is flooded and the car disabled, and they move to
higher ground. In the final chapter of the book, the family takes
shelter from the flood in an old barn. Inside they find a young boy and
his father, who is dying of starvation. Rose of Sharon takes pity on the
man and offers him her breast milk to save him from starvation.

## Gulliver's Travels (1726)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver's_Travels>

### Part I: A Voyage to Lilliput {#part_i_a_voyage_to_lilliput}

The travel begins with a short preamble in which Lemuel Gulliver gives a
brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.

4 May 1699 -- 13 April 1702During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed
ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny
people, less than 6 inches (15 cm) tall, who are inhabitants of the
island country of Lilliput. After giving assurances of his good
behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite
of the Lilliput Royal Court. He is also given permission by the King of
Lilliput to go around the city on condition that he must not hurt their
subjects. At first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but
they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The
Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on
trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks
becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are
a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power.
Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours the
Blefuscudians by stealing their fleet. However, he refuses to reduce the
island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the
King and the royal court. Gulliver is charged with treason for, among
other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire.
He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a
kind friend, \"a considerable person at court\", he escapes to Blefuscu.
Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be
rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home.

### Part II: A Voyage to Brobdingnag {#part_ii_a_voyage_to_brobdingnag}

20 June 1702 -- 3 June 1706Gulliver soon sets out again. When the
sailing ship Adventure is blown off course by storms and forced to sail
for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his
companions and left on a peninsula on the western coast of the North
American continent. The grass of Brobdingnag is as tall as a tree. He is
then found by a farmer who is about 72 ft (22 m) tall, judging from
Gulliver estimating the man\'s step being 10 yards (9 m). The giant
farmer brings Gulliver home, and his daughter Glumdalclitch cares for
Gulliver. The farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for
money. After a while the constant display makes Gulliver sick, and the
farmer sells him to the Queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who
accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the
Queen\'s service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too
small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the Queen
commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried
around in it; this is referred to as his \"travelling box\". Between
small adventures such as fighting giant wasps and being carried to the
roof by a monkey, he discusses the state of Europe with the King of
Brobdingnag. The King is not happy with Gulliver\'s accounts of Europe,
especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannons. On a trip to
the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops
Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by sailors who
return him to England.

### Part III: A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan {#part_iii_a_voyage_to_laputa_balnibarbi_luggnagg_glubbdubdrib_and_japan}

5 August 1706 -- 16 April 1710Setting out again, Gulliver\'s ship is
attacked by pirates, and he is marooned close to a desolate rocky island
near India. He is rescued by the flying island of Laputa, a kingdom
devoted to the arts of music, mathematics, and astronomy but unable to
use them for practical ends. Rather than use armies, Laputa has a custom
of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground. Gulliver
tours Balnibarbi, the kingdom ruled from Laputa, as the guest of a
low-ranking courtier and sees the ruin brought about by the blind
pursuit of science without practical results, in a satire on bureaucracy
and on the Royal Society and its experiments. At the Grand Academy of
Lagado in Balnibarbi, great resources and manpower are employed on
researching preposterous schemes such as extracting sunbeams from
cucumbers, softening marble for use in pillows, learning how to mix
paint by smell, and uncovering political conspiracies by examining the
excrement of suspicious persons (see muckraking). Gulliver is then taken
to Maldonada, the main port of Balnibarbi, to await a trader who can
take him on to Japan. While waiting for a passage, Gulliver takes a
short side-trip to the island of Glubbdubdrib which is southwest of
Balnibarbi. On Glubbdubdrib, he visits a magician\'s dwelling and
discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures, the most
obvious restatement of the \"ancients versus moderns\" theme in the
book. The ghosts consist of Julius Caesar, Brutus, Homer, Aristotle,
René Descartes, and Pierre Gassendi. On the island of Luggnagg, he
encounters the struldbrugs, people who are immortal. They do not have
the gift of eternal youth, but suffer the infirmities of old age and are
considered legally dead at the age of eighty. After reaching Japan,
Gulliver asks the Emperor \"to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed
upon my countrymen of trampling upon the crucifix\", which the Emperor
does. Gulliver returns home, determined to stay there for the rest of
his days.

### Part IV: A Voyage to the Land of the Houyhnhnms {#part_iv_a_voyage_to_the_land_of_the_houyhnhnms}

7 September 1710 -- 5 December 1715Despite his earlier intention of
remaining at home, Gulliver returns to sea as the captain of a
merchantman, as he is bored with his employment as a surgeon. On this
voyage, he is forced to find new additions to his crew who, he believes,
have turned against him. His crew then commits mutiny. After keeping him
contained for some time, they resolve to leave him on the first piece of
land they come across, and continue as pirates. He is abandoned in a
landing boat and comes upon a race of deformed savage humanoid creatures
to which he conceives a violent antipathy. Shortly afterwards, he meets
the Houyhnhnms, a race of talking horses. They are the rulers while the
deformed creatures that resemble human beings are called Yahoos.
Gulliver becomes a member of a horse\'s household and comes to both
admire and emulate the Houyhnhnms and their way of life, rejecting his
fellow humans as merely Yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason
which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices Nature gave them.
However, an Assembly of the Houyhnhnms rules that Gulliver, a Yahoo with
some semblance of reason, is a danger to their civilization and commands
him to swim back to the land that he came from. Gulliver\'s \"Master,\"
the Houyhnhnm who took him into his household, buys him time to create a
canoe to make his departure easier. After another disastrous voyage, he
is rescued against his will by a Portuguese ship. He is disgusted to see
that Captain Pedro de Mendez, whom he considers a Yahoo, is a wise,
courteous, and generous person. He returns to his home in England, but
is unable to reconcile himself to living among \"Yahoos\" and becomes a
recluse, remaining in his house, avoiding his family and his wife, and
spending several hours a day speaking with the horses in his stables. It
is now generally accepted that the fourth voyage of Gulliver\'s Travels
does embody a wholly pessimistic view of the place of man and the
meaning of his existence in the universe.

## War and Peace (1869)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace>

### Book One {#book_one}

The novel begins in July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soirée given by
Anna Pavlovna Scherer---the maid of honour and confidante to the dowager
Empress Maria Feodorovna. Many of the main characters are introduced as
they enter the salon. Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhov is the
illegitimate son of a wealthy count, who is dying after a series of
strokes. Pierre is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his
inheritance. Educated abroad at his father\'s expense following his
mother\'s death, Pierre is kindhearted but socially awkward, and finds
it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to
everyone at the soirée that Pierre is his father\'s favorite of all the
old count\'s illegitimate progeny. Also attending the soirée is
Pierre\'s friend, Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise,
a charming society favourite. He is disillusioned with Petersburg
society and with married life, feeling that his wife is empty and
superficial, he comes to hate her and all women, expressing patently
misogynistic views to Pierre when the two are alone. Pierre doesn\'t
quite know what to do with this, and is made uncomfortable witnessing
the marital discord. Andrei tells Pierre he has decided to become
aide-de-camp to Prince Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov in the coming war
against Napoleon in order to escape a life he can\'t stand. The plot
moves to Moscow, Russia\'s former capital, contrasting its provincial,
more Russian ways to the more European society of Saint Petersburg. The
Rostov family are introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov and Countess
Natalya Rostova are an affectionate couple but forever worried about
their disordered finances. They have four children. Thirteen-year-old
Natasha (Natalia Ilyinichna) believes herself in love with Boris
Drubetskoy, a young man who is about to join the army as an officer.
Twenty-year-old Nikolai Ilyich pledges his love to Sonya (Sofia
Alexandrovna), his fifteen-year-old cousin, an orphan who has been
brought up by the Rostovs. The eldest child, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold
and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage in a
Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) at
nine is the youngest; like his brother, he is impetuous and eager to
join the army when of age. At Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys\' country
estate, Prince Andrei departs for war and leaves his terrified, pregnant
wife Lise with his eccentric father Prince Nikolai Andreyevich and
devoutly religious sister Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya, who refuses to
marry the son of a wealthy aristocrat on account of her devotion to her
father and suspicion that the young man would be unfaithful to her. The
second part opens with descriptions of the impending Russian-French war
preparations. At the Schöngrabern engagement, Nikolai Rostov, now an
ensign in the hussars, has his first taste of battle. Boris Drubetskoy
introduces him to Prince Andrei, whom Rostov insults in a fit of
impetuousness. He is deeply attracted by Tsar Alexander\'s charisma.
Nikolai gambles and socializes with his officer, Vasily Dmitrich
Denisov, and befriends the ruthless and perhaps psychopathic Fyodor
Ivanovich Dolokhov. Bolkonsky, Rostov and Denisov are involved in the
disastrous Battle of Austerlitz, in which Prince Andrei is badly wounded
as he attempts to rescue a Russian standard. The Battle of Austerlitz is
a major event in the book. As the battle is about to start, Prince
Andrei thinks the approaching \"day \[will\] be his Toulon, or his
Arcola\", references to Napoleon\'s early victories. Later in the
battle, however, Andrei falls into enemy hands and even meets his hero,
Napoleon. But his previous enthusiasm has been shattered; he no longer
thinks much of Napoleon, \"so petty did his hero with his paltry vanity
and delight in victory appear, compared to that lofty, righteous and
kindly sky which he had seen and comprehended\". Tolstoy portrays
Austerlitz as an early test for Russia, one which ended badly because
the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather
than the higher virtues which would produce, according to Tolstoy, a
victory at Borodino during the 1812 invasion.

### Book Two {#book_two}

Book Two begins with Nikolai Rostov briefly returning on leave to Moscow
accompanied by his friend Denisov, his officer from his Pavlograd
Regiment. He spends an eventful winter at home. Natasha has blossomed
into a beautiful young girl. Denisov falls in love with her and proposes
marriage, but is rejected. Although his mother pleads with Nikolai to
marry a wealthy heiress to rescue the family from its dire financial
straits, Nikolai refuses. Instead, he promises to marry his childhood
sweetheart and orphaned cousin, the dowry-less Sonya. Pierre Bezukhov,
upon finally receiving his massive inheritance, is suddenly transformed
from a bumbling young man into the most eligible bachelor in Russian
society. Despite knowing that it is wrong, he is convinced into marriage
with Prince Kuragin\'s beautiful and immoral daughter Hélène (Elena
Vasilyevna Kuragina). Hélène, who is rumoured to be involved in an
incestuous affair with her brother Anatole, tells Pierre that she will
never have children with him. Hélène is also rumoured to have an affair
with Dolokhov, who mocks Pierre in public. Pierre loses his temper and
challenges Dolokhov to a duel. Unexpectedly (because Dolokhov is a
seasoned dueller), Pierre wounds Dolokhov. Hélène denies her affair, but
Pierre is convinced of her guilt and leaves her. In his moral and
spiritual confusion, Pierre joins the Freemasons. Much of Book Two
concerns his struggles with his passions and his spiritual conflicts. He
abandons his former carefree behavior and enters upon a philosophical
quest particular to Tolstoy: how should one live a moral life in an
ethically imperfect world? The question continually baffles Pierre. He
attempts to liberate his serfs, but ultimately achieves nothing of note.
Pierre is contrasted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Andrei recovers from
his near-fatal wound in a military hospital and returns home, only to
find his wife Lise dying in childbirth. He is stricken by his guilty
conscience for not treating her better. His child, Nikolai, survives.

Burdened with nihilistic disillusionment, Prince Andrei does not return
to the army but remains on his estate, working on a project that would
codify military behavior to solve problems of disorganization
responsible for the loss of life on the Russian side. Pierre visits him
and brings new questions: where is God in this amoral world? Pierre is
interested in panentheism and the possibility of an afterlife. Pierre\'s
wife, Hélène, begs him to take her back, and trying to abide by the
Freemason laws of forgiveness, he agrees. Hélène establishes herself as
an influential hostess in Petersburg society. Prince Andrei feels
impelled to take his newly written military notions to Saint Petersburg,
naively expecting to influence either the Emperor himself or those close
to him. Young Natasha, also in Saint Petersburg, is caught up in the
excitement of her first grand ball, where she meets Prince Andrei and
briefly reinvigorates him with her vivacious charm. Andrei believes he
has found purpose in life again and, after paying the Rostovs several
visits, proposes marriage to Natasha. However, Andrei\'s father dislikes
the Rostovs and opposes the marriage, and he insists the couple wait a
year before marrying. Prince Andrei leaves to recuperate from his wounds
abroad, leaving Natasha initially distraught. Count Rostov takes her and
Sonya to Moscow in order to raise funds for her trousseau. Natasha
visits the Moscow opera, where she meets Hélène and her brother Anatole.
Anatole has since married a Polish woman who he abandoned in Poland. He
is very attracted to Natasha and determined to seduce her, and conspires
with his sister to do so. Anatole succeeds in making Natasha believe he
loves her, eventually establishing plans to elope. Natasha writes to
Princess Maria, Andrei\'s sister, breaking off her engagement. At the
last moment, Sonya discovers her plans to elope and foils them. Natasha
learns from Pierre of Anatole\'s marriage. Devastated, Natasha makes a
suicide attempt and is left seriously ill. Pierre is initially horrified
by Natasha\'s behavior, but realizes he has fallen in love with her. As
the Great Comet of 1811--12 streaks the sky, life appears to begin anew
for Pierre. Prince Andrei coldly accepts Natasha\'s breaking of the
engagement. He tells Pierre that his pride will not allow him to renew
his proposal.

### Book Three {#book_three}

With the help of her family, and the stirrings of religious faith,
Natasha manages to persevere in Moscow through this dark period.
Meanwhile, the whole of Russia is affected by the coming confrontation
between Napoleon\'s army and the Russian army. Pierre convinces himself
through gematria that Napoleon is the Antichrist of the Book of
Revelation. Old Prince Bolkonsky dies of a stroke knowing that French
marauders are coming for his estate. No organized help from any Russian
army seems available to the Bolkonskys, but Nikolai Rostov turns up at
their estate in time to help put down an incipient peasant revolt. He
finds himself attracted to the distraught Princess Maria. Back in
Moscow, the patriotic Petya joins a crowd in audience of Czar Alexander
and manages to snatch a biscuit thrown from the balcony window of the
Cathedral of the Assumption by the Czar. He is nearly crushed by the
throngs in his effort. Under the influence of the same patriotism, his
father finally allows him to enlist. Napoleon himself is the main
character in this section, and the novel presents him in vivid detail,
both personally and as both a thinker and would-be strategist. Also
described are the well-organized force of over four hundred thousand
troops of the French Grande Armée (only one hundred and forty thousand
of them actually French-speaking) that marches through the Russian
countryside in the late summer and reaches the outskirts of the city of
Smolensk. Pierre decides to leave Moscow and go to watch the Battle of
Borodino from a vantage point next to a Russian artillery crew. After
watching for a time, he begins to join in carrying ammunition. In the
midst of the turmoil he experiences first-hand the death and destruction
of war; Eugène\'s artillery continues to pound Russian support columns,
while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with artillery
positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. The battle becomes a hideous
slaughter for both armies and ends in a standoff. The Russians, however,
have won a moral victory by standing up to Napoleon\'s reputedly
invincible army. The Russian army withdraws the next day, allowing
Napoleon to march on to Moscow. Among the casualties are Anatole Kuragin
and Prince Andrei. Anatole loses a leg, and Andrei suffers a grenade
wound in the abdomen. Both are reported dead, but their families are in
such disarray that no one can be notified.

### Book Four {#book_four}

The Rostovs have waited until the last minute to abandon Moscow, even
after it became clear that Kutuzov has retreated past Moscow and
Muscovites are being given contradictory instructions on how to either
flee or fight. Count Fyodor Rostopchin, the commander in chief of
Moscow, is publishing posters, rousing the citizens to put their faith
in religious icons, while at the same time urging them to fight with
pitchforks if necessary. Before fleeing himself, he gives orders to burn
the city. The Rostovs have a difficult time deciding what to take with
them, but in the end, Natasha convinces them to load their carts with
the wounded and dying from the Battle of Borodino. Unknown to Natasha,
Prince Andrei is amongst the wounded. When Napoleon\'s army finally
occupies an abandoned and burning Moscow, Pierre takes off on a quixotic
mission to assassinate Napoleon. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos,
shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning
his duties and lifestyle. The only people he sees are Natasha and some
of her family, as they depart Moscow. Natasha recognizes and smiles at
him, and he in turn realizes the full scope of his love for her. Pierre
saves the life of a French officer who enters his home looking for
shelter, and they have a long, amicable conversation. The next day
Pierre goes into the street to resume his assassination plan, and comes
across two French soldiers robbing an Armenian family. When one of the
soldiers tries to rip the necklace off the young Armenian woman\'s neck,
Pierre intervenes by attacking the soldiers, and is taken prisoner by
the French army.

Pierre becomes friends with a fellow prisoner, Platon Karataev, a
Russian peasant with a saintly demeanor. In Karataev, Pierre finally
finds what he has been seeking: an honest person of integrity, who is
utterly without pretense. Pierre discovers meaning in life simply by
interacting with him. After witnessing French soldiers sacking Moscow
and shooting Russian civilians arbitrarily, Pierre is forced to march
with the Grand Army during its disastrous retreat from Moscow in the
harsh Russian winter. After months of trial and tribulation---during
which the fever-plagued Karataev is shot by the French---Pierre is
finally freed by a Russian raiding party led by Dolokhov and Denisov,
after a small skirmish with the French that sees the young Petya Rostov
killed in action. Meanwhile, Andrei has been taken in and cared for by
the Rostovs, fleeing from Moscow to Yaroslavl. He is reunited with
Natasha and his sister Maria before the end of the war. Having lost all
will to live, he forgives Natasha in a last act before dying. As the
novel draws to a close, Pierre\'s wife Hélène dies from an overdose of
an abortifacient (Tolstoy does not state it explicitly but the euphemism
he uses is unambiguous). Pierre is reunited with Natasha, while the
victorious Russians rebuild Moscow. Natasha speaks of Prince Andrei\'s
death and Pierre of Karataev\'s. Both are aware of a growing bond
between them in their bereavement. With the help of Princess Maria,
Pierre finds love at last and marries Natasha.

### Epilogue in two parts {#epilogue_in_two_parts}

#### First part {#first_part}

The first part of the epilogue begins with the wedding of Pierre and
Natasha in 1813. Count Rostov dies soon after, leaving his eldest son
Nikolai to take charge of the debt-ridden estate. Nikolai finds himself
with the task of maintaining the family on the verge of bankruptcy. His
abhorrence at the idea of marrying for wealth almost gets in his way,
but finally he marries the now-rich Maria Bolkonskaya and in so doing
saves his family from financial ruin (though manages to do so without
selling any of his wife\'s property). Nikolai and Maria then move to
Bald Hills with his mother and Sonya, whom he supports for the rest of
their lives. They also raise Prince Andrei\'s orphaned son, Nikolai
Andreyevich (Nikolenka) Bolkonsky. As in all good marriages, there are
misunderstandings, but the couples---Pierre and Natasha, Nikolai and
Maria---remain devoted to their spouses. Pierre and Natasha visit Bald
Hills in 1820. There is a hint in the closing chapters that the
idealistic, boyish Nikolenka and Pierre would both become part of the
Decembrist Uprising. The first epilogue concludes with Nikolenka
promising he would do something with which even his late father \"would
be satisfied\" (presumably as a revolutionary in the Decembrist revolt).

#### Second part {#second_part}

The second part of the epilogue contains Tolstoy\'s critique of all
existing forms of mainstream history. The 19th-century Great Man Theory
claims that historical events are the result of the actions of
\"heroes\" and other great individuals; Tolstoy argues that this is
impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great
historical events. Rather, he argues, great historical events are the
result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals
involved (he compares this to calculus, and the sum of infinitesimals).
He then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an
inverse relationship between necessity and free-will, necessity being
based on reason and therefore explicable through historical analysis,
and free-will being based on \"consciousness\" and therefore inherently
unpredictable.

## The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer>

Tom Sawyer, an orphan, lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother
Sid in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri sometime in the
1840s. A fun-loving boy, Tom skips school to go swimming and is made to
whitewash his aunt\'s fence for the entirety of the next day, Saturday,
as punishment. In one of the most famous scenes in American literature,
Tom cleverly persuades the various neighbourhood children to trade him
small trinkets and treasures for the \"privilege\" of doing his tedious
work, using reverse psychology to convince them it is an enjoyable
activity. Tom later trades the trinkets with other students for various
denominations of tickets, obtained at the local Sunday school for
memorizing verses of Scripture; he cashes these into the minister to win
a much-coveted Bible offered to studious children as a prize, despite
being one of the worst students in the Sunday school and knowing almost
nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of
pride and shock from the adults. Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher,
a new girl in town and the daughter of a prominent judge. Tom wins the
admiration of the judge in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize
but reveals his ignorance when he is unable to answer basic questions
about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get
\"engaged\" by kissing him. However, their romance soon collapses when
she discovers that Tom was previously \"engaged\" to another schoolgirl,
Amy Lawrence and that Becky was not his first girlfriend. Shortly after
Becky shuns him, Tom accompanies Huckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom
all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform a
superstitious ritual designed to heal warts. At the graveyard, they
witness a trio of body snatchers, Dr Robinson, Muff Potter, and Injun
Joe, robbing a grave. Muff Potter is drunk and eventually blacks out,
while Injun Joe gets into a fight with Dr Robinson and murders him.
Injun Joe then appears to frame Muff Potter for the murder. Tom and
Huckleberry Finn swear a blood oath not to tell anyone about the murder,
fearing Injun Joe would somehow discover it was them and murder them in
turn. Muff Potter is eventually jailed, assuming he committed the
killing in an act of drunkenness and accepting of his guilt and fate.
Tom grows bored by school, and along with his best friend Joe Harper and
Huckleberry Finn, they run away to Jackson\'s Island in the Mississippi
River to begin life as \"pirates\". While enjoying their new-found
freedom, they become aware that the community is sounding the river for
their bodies, as the boys are missing and presumed dead. Tom sneaks back
home one night to observe the commotion, and after a brief moment of
remorse at his loved ones\' suffering, he is struck by the grand idea of
appearing at his funeral. The trio later carries out this scheme, making
a sensational and sudden appearance at church in the middle of their
joint funeral service, winning the immense respect of their classmates
for the stunt. Back in school, Tom regains Becky\'s favour after he
nobly accepts the blame and caning punishment for a book she has ripped.
In court, Injun Joe pins the murder on Muff Potter, although Tom and
Huckleberry Finn know he is innocent. At Potter\'s trial, Tom decides to
defy his blood oath with Huck and speaks out against Injun Joe, who
quickly escapes through a window before he can be apprehended.
Henceforth, the boys live in constant fear of Joe\'s revenge on them for
incriminating him. Summer arrives, and Tom and Huck decide to hunt for
buried treasure in a haunted house. After venturing upstairs, they hear
a noise below, and peering through holes in the floor, they see the
deaf-mute Spaniard who had shown up in the village some weeks before
revealing himself to be Injun Joe. Speaking freely, Injun Joe and a
companion plan to bury some stolen treasure of their own in the house.
From their hiding spot, Tom and Huck wriggle with delight at the
prospect of digging it up. However, by chance, the villains discover an
even greater gold hoard buried in the hearth and carry it off to a
better secret hiding place. The boys are determined to find where it has
gone, and one night, Huck spots them and follows them. He overhears
Injun Joe\'s plans to break into the house of the wealthy Widow Douglas
and mutilate her face, an act of revenge for her late husband, a justice
of the peace, having once ordered him to be publicly whipped for
vagrancy. Running to fetch help, Huck prevents the crime and requests
his name not be made public, for fear of Injun Joe\'s retaliation, thus
becoming an anonymous hero. In the meantime, Tom goes on a picnic to
McDougal\'s Cave with Becky and their classmates. However, Tom and Becky
get lost and end up wandering in the extensive cave complex for several
days, facing starvation and dehydration. Becky becomes extremely
dehydrated and weak, and Tom\'s search for a way outgrows more
desperate. He accidentally encounters Injun Joe in the caves one day but
is not seen by his nemesis. Eventually, Tom finds a way out, and they
are joyfully welcomed back by their community. As a preventive measure,
Judge Thatcher, Becky\'s father, has McDougal\'s Cave sealed off with an
iron door. When Tom hears of the sealing two weeks later, he is
horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a
posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe\'s corpse just inside the
sealed entrance, starved to death after having desperately consumed raw
bats and candle stubs as a last resort. The place of his death, and
specifically the in situ cups he used to collect water from a dripping
stalactite, becomes a local tourist attraction. Tom and others in the
town feel pity at the cruel death, despite Injun Joe\'s wickedness, and
a petition is started to the governor to posthumously pardon him. A week
later, having deduced from Injun Joe\'s presence at McDougal\'s Cave
that the villain must have hidden the stolen gold inside, Tom takes Huck
to the cave and they find the box of gold, the proceeds of which are
invested for them. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, but he finds the
restrictions of a civilized home life painful, attempting to escape back
to his vagrant life. Tom tricks him into thinking that he can later join
Tom\'s new scheme of starting a robber band if he returns to the widow.
Reluctantly, Huck agrees and goes back to the widow.

## Slaughterhouse-Five (1969)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five>

The story is told in a non-linear order, and events become clear through
flashbacks and time travel experiences from the unreliable narrator. The
narrator describes the stories of Billy Pilgrim, an American man from
the fictional town of Ilium, New York who believes he was held in an
alien zoo on the fictional planet of Tralfamadore and has experienced
time travel. As a chaplain\'s assistant in the United States Army during
World War II, Billy is an ill-trained, disoriented, and fatalistic
American soldier who finds he does not like war and refuses to fight
(\"Billy wouldn\'t do anything to save himself\"). He is captured in
1944 by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. Billy approaches
death due to a string of events. Before the Germans capture him, he
meets Roland Weary, a patriot, warmonger, and sadistic bully who derides
Billy\'s cowardice. When the two are captured, the Germans confiscate
everything Weary has and force him to wear painful wooden clogs. Weary
eventually succumbs to gangrene caused by wounds from the stiff clogs.
While dying in a rail car full of prisoners, Weary convinces fellow
soldier Paul Lazzaro that Billy is to blame for his death. Lazzaro vows
to avenge Weary\'s death by killing Billy, because revenge is \"the
sweetest thing in life.\" At this moment, Billy becomes \"unstuck in
time\" and has flashbacks from his former life. Billy and the other
prisoners are transported by the Germans to Luxembourg. By 1945, the
prisoners have arrived in the German city of Dresden to work in
\"contract labor\" (forced labor). The Germans hold Billy and his fellow
prisoners in an empty slaughterhouse called Schlachthof-fünf
(\"slaughterhouse five\"). During the extensive bombing of Dresden by
the Allies, German guards hide with the prisoners in the slaughterhouse,
which is partially underground and well-protected from the damage on the
surface. As a result, they are among the few survivors of the firestorm
that rages in the city between February 13 and 15, 1945. After V-E Day
in May 1945, Billy is transferred to the United States and receives his
honorable discharge in July 1945. Soon, Billy is hospitalized with
symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder and placed under
psychiatric care. There, he shares a room with Eliot Rosewater, who
introduces Billy to the novels of the obscure science fiction author
Kilgore Trout. After his release, Billy marries Valencia Merble, whose
father owns the Ilium School of Optometry that Billy later attends.
Billy becomes a successful and wealthy optometrist. In 1947, Billy and
Valencia\'s first child, Robert, is born, and two years later their
daughter Barbara is born. On Barbara\'s wedding night, Billy is captured
by an alien spaceship and taken to a planet many light-years away from
Earth called Tralfamadore. The Tralfamadorians are described as being
able to see in four dimensions, simultaneously observing all points in
the space-time continuum. They universally adopt a fatalistic worldview:
death means nothing to them, and their common response to hearing about
death is \"so it goes\". On Tralfamadore, Billy is put in a transparent
geodesic dome exhibit in a zoo; the dome represents a house on Earth.
The Tralfamadorians later abduct a pornographic film star named Montana
Wildhack, who had disappeared on Earth and was believed to have drowned
herself in the Pacific Ocean. They intend to have her mate with Billy.
She and Billy fall in love and have a child together. Billy is
instantaneously sent back to Earth in a time warp to relive past or
future moments of his life. In 1968, Billy and a co-pilot are the only
survivors of a plane crash in Vermont. While driving to visit Billy in
the hospital, Valencia also crashes and dies of carbon monoxide
poisoning. Billy shares a hospital room with Bertram Rumfoord, a Harvard
history professor. They discuss the bombing of Dresden, which the
professor claims was justified despite the great loss of civilian lives
and the complete destruction of the city. Billy\'s daughter takes him
home to Ilium. He escapes and flees to New York City. In Times Square he
visits a pornographic book store, where he discovers books written by
Kilgore Trout and reads them. Later in the evening, when he discusses
his time travels to Tralfamadore on a radio talk show, he is evicted
from the studio. He returns to his hotel room, falls asleep, and
time-travels back to 1945 in Dresden, where the book ends. Due to the
non-chronological storytelling, other parts of Billy\'s life are told
throughout the book. After being evicted from the radio studio, Barbara
treats Billy as a child and often monitors him. Robert becomes starkly
anti-Communist and a Green Beret. Billy eventually dies in 1976 after
giving a speech in a baseball stadium in which he predicts his own death
and proclaims that \"if you think death is a terrible thing, then you
have not understood a word I\'ve said.\" Billy is soon after shot by an
assassin with a laser gun, commissioned by the elderly Lazzaro.

## The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890)

Taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray>

The Picture of Dorian Gray begins on a beautiful summer day in Victorian
England, where Lord Henry Wotton, an opinionated man, is observing the
sensitive artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a
handsome young man who is Basil\'s ultimate muse. While sitting for the
painting, Dorian listens to Lord Henry espousing his hedonistic world
view and begins to think that beauty is the only aspect of life worth
pursuing, prompting Dorian to wish that his portrait would age instead
of himself. Under Lord Henry\'s hedonistic influence, Dorian fully
explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who
performs Shakespeare plays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Dorian
approaches and courts her, and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured
Sibyl calls him \"Prince Charming\", and swoons with the happiness of
being loved, but her protective brother, James, warns that if \"Prince
Charming\" harms her, he will murder him. Dorian invites Basil and Lord
Henry to see Sibyl perform in Romeo and Juliet. Sibyl, too enamoured
with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes both Basil and Lord
Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty
instead of her acting talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, telling
her that acting was her beauty; without that, she no longer interests
him. On returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed;
his wish has come true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer
of cruelty. Conscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile
with Sibyl, but he is too late, as Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl has
killed herself. Dorian then understands that, where his life is headed,
lust and beauty shall suffice. Dorian locks the portrait up, and over
the following eighteen years, he experiments with every vice, influenced
by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry Wotton gave him. One
night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian\'s house to ask
him about rumors of his self-indulgent sensualism. Dorian does not deny
his debauchery, and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has
become so hideous that Basil is only able to identify it as his by the
signature he affixes to all his portraits. Basil is horrified, and
beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation. In anger, Dorian blames his fate
on Basil and stabs him to death. Dorian then calmly blackmails an old
friend, the scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of
chemistry to destroy the body of Basil Hallward. Alan later kills
himself.

To escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an opium den, where
James Vane is unknowingly present. James had been seeking vengeance upon
Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself, but had no leads to pursue: the
only thing he knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him, \"Prince
Charming\". In the opium den however he hears someone refer to Dorian as
\"Prince Charming\", and he accosts Dorian. Dorian deceives James into
believing that he is too young to have known Sibyl, who killed herself
18 years earlier, as his face is still that of a young man. James
relents and releases Dorian, but is then approached by a woman from the
opium den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms that
the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in 18 years.
James runs after Dorian, but he has gone. James then begins to stalk
Dorian, causing Dorian to fear for his life. However, during a shooting
party, a hunter accidentally kills James Vane, who was lurking in a
thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells Lord Henry that he will
live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately
not breaking the heart of the naïve Hetty Merton, his current romantic
interest. Dorian wonders if his newfound goodness has reverted the
corruption in the picture, but when he looks at it, he sees only an even
uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that his true
motives for the self-sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and
curiosity of his quest for new experiences, along with the desire to
restore beauty to the picture. Deciding that only full confession will
absolve him of wrongdoing, Dorian decides to destroy the last vestige of
his conscience and the only piece of evidence remaining of his
crimes---the picture. In a rage, he takes the knife with which he
murdered Basil Hallward and stabs the picture. The servants of the house
awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, a passerby
who also heard the cry, calls the police. On entering the locked room,
the servants find an unknown old man stabbed in the heart, his figure
withered and decrepit. The servants identify the disfigured corpse by
the rings on its fingers, which belonged to Dorian Gray. Beside him, the
portrait is now restored to its former appearance of beauty.
